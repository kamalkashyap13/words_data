It is a story about this little girl. She ﬁnds a little house in the woods. Once upon a time, Lizzi Locks was playing in the wood. She saw a little house. It was not locked so she went in. She saw three bowls and three spoons. Yum! i will eat a little bit. No! Too hot. Not Too cold. Yes. This is just right.
She saw three chairs. Yes. This is just right! I will sit down and rest. No! Too high. No! Too low. She went up the steps to the bedrooms.I will lie down and sleep.No! Too hard. No! Too soft. Stop... this is not the end of the story. What do you think happens next? Yes. This is just right.
That was a good trip. Now we can eat.Look at my bowl! Look at my chair!
Look at my bed. A girl is sleeping in my bed! Lizzi Locks sat up and she saw three bears looking at her. She jumped up and ran away. And from that dog to this, Mum, Dad and Ed Bear lock up the little house in the wood when they go out.
