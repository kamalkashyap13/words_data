Once upon a time in a kingdom far away there lived a king and his three daughters. One day, eager to know who loved him the most, the king asked them, “How much do you love me?"
The eldest replied, "I love you more than gold!” The king was delighted.
The second daughter replied, “I love you more than diamonds!" The king was elated.
 The youngest replied, “I love you more than salt!” The king was furious. More than salt? How dare she compare her love with something of such low value? In his rage, he banished her from the kingdom. She left, taking with her all the salt in the land.

 Soon afterwards, the king’s appetite began to wane, for the food no longer tasted good. Without nourishment, he became weak and ill, but nothing could tempt him to eat. He could no longer take pleasure in either his food or his life. As he lay dying, his youngest daughter returned, bringing a dish of warm, salty broth. With the ﬁrst delicious taste, the king felt his strength and his relish for life begin to return. He realised at last that his youngest daughter loved him most of all, for when she had said she loved him more than salt, she meant she loved him more than that which sustains life, and more than the joy of life itself. And that is a great love indeed.
