 I wake around 6, but my duties as a human — a living incarnation of the Hindu goddess Taleju — don’t start until later. I wear red robes to bed, but I change into more elaborate ones with gold embroidery for daytime and I put on my jewellery My father always does my make-up for me. He is an artist and my mother is a housewife, and I have two younger brothers, aged 13 and 10. I live with my family in Lalitpur in Kathmandu. I have been a human for as long as I can remember.  At 8 we do puja, a religious ritual that must be performed every day. I sit on my throne in my puja room and my mother will bring offerings of fruit and rice on special metal platters. She burns incense, lights butter lamps and recites mantras. When I am in the puja room I am the goddess Taleju. Nobody is allowed to speak to me and I must not talk. Perhaps it’s because of this that even outside the puja room I am very uncomfortable speaking to people, apart from my family.  Puja usually takes half an hour, and after that I have my breakfast of chiya and roti. Then I do my homework. I have been working hard this year because I had to take my school leaving exam in the spring. Now I’m doing my equivalent to A-levels.


After my homework we sit down to our main meal, which we have before midday. It’s always dahl, curry and rice. At 12 I go back to the puja room, and between then and 1 pm. I receive devotees. I bless them with a tikka (a spot of red dust) on the forehead.  They bring fruit, rice or coconut, bow down before me and say ‘ Namaste ’. People might think it feels odd to sit on a throne and give blessings, but it doesn’t to me because it’s what I have always done. I was six when I became a kumari. My mother says she knew from the moment I was born that I was unique. She says I looked very knowing.  The priests decide who becomes a kuman ’, and make the choice based on a girl’s age, horoscope and physical attributes.  At 1 pm. my lessons start. I have three teachers who come to the house. My brothers go to the local school, but I am not allowed to leave the house, except on one of the, 19 annual festival days. Then, as Taleju, I am carried through the streets in a palanquin to be present at all the ceremonies. I cannot talk to anyone; I can only watch the rites in the temple.  I never think about going outside. I think if I were to sneak out to buy sweets or anything like that, I should feel sick — it’s not how a kumcm' behaves. If I did something a goddess should not do, who knows what impact it could have on the__Nepali people?  When another local girl takes over from me as kumari, I’d like to go on to college and study accountancy. I believe that if you study hard, you can do anything in life.  My lessons finish at 7, and at 8 we have our evening meal, which is the same as the morning’s. I am allowed to eat with my family, but my food has to be prepared separately, in special dishes that have to be ritually cleaned.  In the evening I watch television or go on the computer — I have a Hotrnail account — and hang outwith my brothers. So I suppose that for an hour or so I’m a normal teenager. But because of my duties I have always been too busy to play, so I don’t have any of my own friends.  I can’t really begin to imagine what my life will be like when I am able to go outside with my brothers and to college. Right now I am just living from day to day, and because I’m always with my family, whom I love, I enjoy that. I go to bed at 10, in my own room, which has a small wooden bed. I never dream.

Thinking quickly, the King said, ‘To slay me here, since you are
armed and I dressed humbly in my hunting clothes, would bring
you no honour, and shame would follow you for the rest of your
life. I’ll grant you anything you care to name - any amount of land
or gold - to spare my life.’

‘There is no land or gold, of any amount, that I desire,’ said
the Knight. ‘However, I will get what I seek in an honourable way.
I’ll give you a chance to solve a riddle. One year and a day from
now, you must appear before me here in these woods, without
companions and without weapons. If at that time you are unable to
solve this riddle, there can be no objection to my taking your life.
But if you answer the riddle correctly, there will be no battle and
you will be free to leave. You must swear on your honour that you
will return in one year and a day, as I have commanded.’

‘I agree to your terms,’ said the King. ‘What is the riddle?’
The first cry of a newborn baby in Chicago or Zamboango,
in Amsterdam or Rangoon, has the same pitch and hey, each
saying, ‘I am! I have come through! I belong! I am a member
of the Family!

The morning my sister was born, my Dad slipped a note under my
pillow while I was still asleep. It said: ‘Congratulations! You’ve got a
baby sister.’ I woke, found it, grunted, shoved the note back under
my pillow and went to sleep again.

When I saw her for the first time I was surprised. I’d expected
her either to have a head of hair, or none at all. What I saw was a
thin strip of jet-black hair that ran like a mane down the centre of
her head. On balance, I decided she was quite interesting and that
having a sister would be all right.


I was seven when my sister was born and I’d never had to share
things with another child. Not that I remember it as a problem.
Previously, I’d invented half a million games-to-play-by-yourself;
now I had someone to talk to, read to, play with - teach to walk.
Later we fell out - partly because she was too clever. I’d teach her
card games, for instance, then she’d beat me. We had arguments.

I threatened to hit her. She threatened to tell Mum or Dad. I hit

her. She told Mum or Dad. Sometimes they hit me. There were
variations on this theme but I always seemed to find myself on the
losing end!

That morning in March 2000, 63-year-old Tonie
Joubert saw a newborn baby hippo washed

up onto the lawn of his riverside home near

Hoedspruit in South Africa. The River Blyde had

flooded and almost reached his house.

Joubert found that the baby hippo was only a
few hours old. ‘She was very, very weak, so weak
she couldn’t stand up. I knew I had to save her
life’, says Joubert, a game ranger. He nursed and
bottle-fed the 15 kilo baby back to health with
the help of his wife, Shirley.

She survived, and grew, and grew. She became
a giant - and she also became convinced that
she was part of the family; She now weighs nearly
three-quarters of a ton. Like most teenagers,
she finds family life too comfortable to want to
leave home, and has a double life which includes
wild hippos as well as the family. Attempts to
reintroduce her to the wild have all failed. And,
being free to roam, the danger now is that she will
be attacked and killed by other hippos - or shot by
local farmers protecting their animals and crops.

Jessica eats, sleep, swims and plays with Tonie
and Shirley. What’s more, she wanders round
the house, drinks coffee on the verandah, hangs
out with the family dogs, and enjoys Shirley’s
soothing massages that help her relax at the
end of a happy hippo day. She greets Tonie with
special grunts and flicking ears whenever she
sees him, and follows him like a dog wherever
he goes. She has shown problem-solving abilities
and a willingness to respond to commands. When
Joubert says the Afrikaans word for yes, she
closes her eyes; when he tells her to sit, she sits.
She has never shown any aggression.

The daily routine includes 10 litres of sweet
warm coffee fed through a bottle, and dog
biscuits as special treats. Although she returns to
the river most evenings for a mud bath, she also
enjoys lying on the couple’s bed. She not only
covers it in slime, but has broken it three times.
She has learned how to open doors by turning

the key, so it’s impossible to keep her out of the
bedroom.

Her friend and potential mate, Charlie, was
shot by a neighbouring farmer. ‘Jessica is too
trusting of humans,’ says Shirley. ‘Our constant
fear now is that the same fate as Charlie’s may
befall our precious Jess, the gentlest creature on
Earth.’ But the couple are certain that if they had
not rescued her she would have been eaten by a
crocodile. And they and she would have missed
out on joy and companionship.

The Jouberts aim to establish a hippo reserve
where Jessica and the rest of the herd can live
safely. ‘These are beautiful creatures and we
should look after them,’ says Joubert.

They sent me a salwar kameez peacock-blue, and another glistening like an orange split open, embossed slippers, gold and black points curling. Candy-striped glass bangles snapped, drew blood. Like at school, fashions changed in Pakistan — the salwar bottoms were broad and stiff, then narrow. My aunts chose an apple-green sari, silver-bordered for my teens. 
I tried each satin-silken top — was alien in the sitting-room. I could never be as lovely as those clothes


I longed
for denim and corduroy.
My costume clung to me
and I was aflame,
I couldn’t rise up out of its fire,
half-English,
unlike Aunt Jamila.
I wanted my parents’ camel-skin lamp
switching it on in my bedroom,
to consider the cruelty
and the transformation
from camel to shade,
marvel at the colours
like stained glass.
My mother cherished her jewellery
Indian gold, dangling, filigree,
But it was stolen from our car.
The presents were radiant in my wardrobe.
My aunts requested cardigans
from Marks and Spencers.
My salwar kameez
didn’t impress the schoolfriend
who sat on my bed, asked to see
my weekend clothes.
But often I admired the mirror-work,
tried to glimpse myself
in the miniature
glass circles, recall the story
how the three of us
sailed to England.
Prickly heat had me screaming on the way
I ended up in a cot
in my English grandmother’s dining-room,
found myself alone,
playing with a tin-boat.
I pictured my birthplace
from fifties’ photographs.
When I was older
there was conflict, a fractured land
throbbing through newsprint.

Sometimes I saw Lahore — my aunts in shaded rooms, screened from male visitors, 
sorting presents, wrapping them in tissue. 
Or there were beggars, sweeper-girls and I was there — of no fixed nationality, staring through fretwork at the Shalimar Gardens. 

She kept an antique shop - or it kept her.
Among Apostle Spoons and Bristol glass,

The faded silks, the heavy furniture,

She watched her own reflection in the brass
Salvers and silver bowls, as if to prove

Polish was all, there was no need of love.
And I remember how I once refused

To go outwith her, since I was afraid.

It was perhaps a wish not to be used

Like antique objects. Though she never said
That she was hurt, I still could feel the guilt
Of that refusal, guessing how she felt.

Later, too frail to keep a shop, she put

All her best things in one narrow room.

The place smelt old, of things too long kept
The smell of absences where shadows come
That can’t be polished. There was nothing the
To give her own reflection back again.

And when she died I felt no grief at all, Only the guilt of what I once refused. I walked into her room among the tall Sideboards and cupboards — things she never used But needed; and no finger marks were there, Only the new dust falling through the air.
