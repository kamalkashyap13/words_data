The creek had hardly been crossed before the Hanging Rock had risen up directly ahead of the four girls, clearly visible beyond  a short grassy slope. The immediate impact of its soaring peaks induced a silence so impregnated with its powerful presence that even Edith was struck dumb. The splendid spectacle, as if by special arrangement between Heaven and the Head Mistress of Appleyard College, was brilliantly illuminated for their inspection. On the steep southern facade the play of golden light and deep violet shade revealed the intricate construction of long vertical slabs; some smooth as giant tombstones, others grooved and ﬂuted by prehistoric architecture of wind and water, ice and fire. Huge boulders. originally spewed red hot from the boiling bowels of the earth, now come to rest. cooled and rounded in forest shade.

Confronted by such monumental configurations of nature the human eye is woefully inadequate. Who can say how many or how few of its unfolding marvels are actually seen, selected and recorded by the four pairs of eyes now fixed in staring wonder at the Hanging Rock?  Does Marion Quade  note the horizontal  ledges crisscrossing the verticals of the main pattern whose geological formation must be memorised for next Monday’s essay? ls Edith aware of the hundreds of frail starlike flowers crushed under her tramping boots, while Irma catches the scarlet flash of a parrot‘s wing and thinks it a flame amongst the leaves? And Miranda, whose feet appear to be choosing their own way through the ferns as she tilts her head towards the glittering peaks, does she already feel herself more than a spectator agape at a holiday pantomime? So they walk silently towards the lower slopes, in single file, each locked in the private world of her own perceptions, unconscious of the strains and tensions of the molten mass that hold it anchored to the groaning earth: of the creakings and shudderings, the wandering airs and currents known only to the wise little bats, hanging upside down in its clammy caves. None of them see or hear the snake dragging its copper coils over the stones ahead. Nor the panic exodus of spiders, grubs and woodlice from rotting leaves and bark. There are no tracks on this part of the Rock. Or if there ever have been tracks, they are long since obliterated. It is a long long time since any living creature other than an occasional rabbit or wallaby trespassed upon its arid breast.


For a truly breathtaking South African adventure, come and explore
the Great Karoo. The Great Karoo is an awe-inspiring landscape of
undulating plains and soaring mountains, with some of the most
spectacular scenery and wildlife to be found on earth. This unspoilt
region still bears many traces of its ancient past, including rock
paintings left by the hunters and shepherds who lived here many
thousands of years ago. The places where you find it are very secluded,
so the art is undamaged and totally magnificent.
The towns of the Great Karoo have their own welcoming
atmosphere. There’s a timelessness that is completely different from
the big cities. This is perhaps the only place in South Africa where you
still have real village life. Working farms with appealing guesthouses
are some of the best places to stay here. See the traditional Karoo
architectural style of walls of brick and stone, reed ceilings, poplar
wood roof timbers and a corrugated-iron roof.
The Great Karoo is a beckoning place of limitless adventures,
where you can visit game reserves, or go horse-riding, hang-gliding or
whitewater tubing. The dazzling scenery is just incredible; there's a
never-ending display of wildlife: antelopes, Wildebeest, jackals, Wildcats,
and the birdlife is really amazing.
So if you want a genuine thrill - and a fantastic holiday - don’t
delay: the Great Karoo is waiting for you.

I stayed at the Garden on a business trip,
staying five nights in total. Upon arrival, 
the reception staff were very friendly. My 
room was comfortable; It was rather old
fashioned and hadn’t been decorated for 
many a decade, but it contained the basic 
facilities, except for a fridge. The room was
clean, the towels were plentiful and fresh
and there was a TV With English-speaking
channels. There was sufficient choice at
breakfast and eggs were cooked to order. On one occasion I ate dinner there too, and
the service was good and the food tasty, although the menu is rather limited. The
location is excellent for relaxing after a hard day’s work. The beautiful gardens, a
with a variety of trees and plants, and animal sculptures amusingly positioned,
are a hideaway in which you can sit outside in the day or at night in comfort
and safety.
ii Hotel Casa del Halcon, Mexico City a
We hadn’t prebooked for our weekend stay, but were given a room at the front of
the hotel overlooking the street and a lovely park with a fountain. It was quiet in
the evening, owing to the area being more residential than commercial. Our room was cleaned daily. We had a hammock on our balcony and the bed was comfortable. 
A Mexican continental breakfast was included, and the kitchen staff were very
obliging. The front desk staff were mostly very friendly and helpful, and probably
would have been more so if we spoke Spanish. There are several good places to eat
nearby, but they are not easy to find. The hotel is within walking distance of the
metro station and bus stop. Breakfast was accompanied by loud recorded music we
could have done without. The most important facility was the free WiFi.

This is one of a chain of historic, high-standard hotels in India, all beautifully
designed in perfect locations, but very different. I loved this one for its wonderful
infinity pool, the great gym facilities, attentive staff and wonderful internal shopping
area. The beds are so generously sized and comfortable that you will not want to
get up in the morning. Because I was there for work, I ate alone each night at one of
their many ethnic restaurants. The food each time was authentic and delicious. Don’t
l miss the patisserie with its wonderful and unique cakes fashioned in the shapes of handbags or shoes.

The Google Driverless Car I
If there’s anything more scary than
a car with a mad or incompetent
driver, it’s a car with no driver
right? Not so, say the gurus of 
Google. A mixture of ultimate-tech
mini-computers and the archived 
knowledge of Google’s Streetview
cameras mean that a driverless car 
is actually safer than one with a 
human being at the wheel.
And that's not just the view of 
few techno-extremists at Google’s 
Mountain View headquarters; as of May 2012, the state of Nevada in the USA has licensed Google's  cars to drive on public highways with no human on board.
As long ago as 2005, the genius Sebastian Thrun, who works for
Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, led a team
which won a $2 million prize from the Department of Defense in the
USA for developing an autonomous, driverless car. Since then, the
concept has been refined to the point where the cautious lawmakers
of Nevada believe that Google’s car really can judge real-life road
situations as well as, if not better than, a traditional driver.
How does it work? The car (a Toyota Prius, initially) is heavily
modified with a stunning array of detectors, including radar,
camera and LIDAR - a new technology using laser beams to map
the area around the car with extraordinary precision and detail.
The input of these sensors is integrated by a sophisticated Artificial
Intelligence (AI) system, which compares the images with the
stored Streetview database to work out exactly where the car is. The
Al unit knows the layout of the road ahead and can drive efficiently
to avoid sudden braking and acceleration. The sensors critically
keep it aware of other traffic to avoid collisions.
And the final result? Nearly a quarter of a million kilometres
driven on public roads without an accident. How many humans
can claim such a record? And this is only the beginning.
