A small hedgehog called Max was run over by a bicycle when he was crossing the road on a zebra crossing.
He remembered nothing of his journey home, wobbling dazedly along on the now deserted pavement, guided only by his sense of smell. All he knew was that he had an awful headache.

The family all crowded round him on his return, all talking at once.
“Where have you been all this time?” asked Ma.
“Are you all right, son?” asked Pa. “Did you cross the road?” they both said, and Peony, Pansy and Petunia echoed, “Did you? Did you? Did you?”
For a while, Max did not reply. His thoughts were muddled, and when he did speak, his words were muddled too.
“I got a head on the bump,” he said slowly. The family looked at one another. “Something bot ‘me on the hittom,” said Max, “and then I headed my bang. My ache bads headly.”
“But did you cross the road?” cried his sisters. “Yes,” said Max wearily. “I hound where the fumans cross over, but —” “But the traffic only stops if you’re a human?” interrupted Pa. “Yes,” said Max. “Not if you’re a hodgeheg.”
Hedgehogs live in many parts of Africa,Asia and Europe. They sleep during theday and come out at night to eat slugsand insects. They are covered in spines and can roll themselves into a ball if they think they are in danger.

Jub’s job was important and she was very proud of it. Each evening when dusk was removing the outline of things, like a rubber, Jub had to shoulder her big green sack and carry all the Happy Endings of stories from one end of the forest to the other in time for everybody’s bedtime. Once she had reached the edge of the forest, Jub had to climb to the topof a huge oak tree, still with her sack on her back, and sit on the tallest branch. Then, very carefully, Jub would open the sack and shake out the Happy Endings into the violet evening air. She was good at this because  she had six fingers on each small hand.

Then one bright day Mother and Father Albatross looked at Little Albatross and saw how big he was, and how strong. it would be quite safe, they thought, to leave him for a while and go off fishing together. So away they ﬂew, out over the cliff top, singing again their soaring song, the song of the wandering albatross. They did not see the killer bird beneath them. But the killer bird saw them. He was watching. He was waiting.

“Oh Father! Oh Mother!” cried Little Albatross, who had never before been left on his own. “Come back! Come back!” But the wind screamed and the waves roared and they could not hear him. Out over the surging sea they soared, always on the look—out for silver ﬂashing fish swimming below them in the surging sea. One glimpse was all they needed.

That night, Little Albatross slept alone on his nest. He did not see the killer bird skulking closer, closer. When morning came, Father and Mother Albatross were still wandering the ocean together, still soaring high above the grey—green sea, when they saw a fishing boat beneath them. And look! Following behind were thousands upon thousands of silver flashing fish. A feast of fish! Down they dived at once without ever thinking, down into the surging sea where they snatched up fish after ﬁsh after fish. Then up they swam, up towards the light, up towards the air.
