‘Curiouser and curiouser! ’ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); ‘now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good—bye, feet!’ (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). ‘Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, clears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! 1 shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; but I must be kind to them,’ thought Alice, ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas. ’  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. ‘They must go by the carrier, ’ she thought; ‘and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!


Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!’  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.  ‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself,’ said Alice, ‘a great girl like you,’ (she might well say this), ‘to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you! ’ But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, ‘Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! ,Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting! ’  Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, ‘If you please, sir —’ The Rabbit started Violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and scurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: ‘Dear, dear!  How queer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle! ’

The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. Oh, I beg your pardon! cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. I quite forgot you didnt like cats. Not like cats! cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. Would you like cats if you were me? Well, perhaps not, said Alice in  a soothing tone: dont be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing, Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face — and shes such a nice soft thing to nurse — and shes such a capital one for catching mice — oh, I beg your pardon! cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. We wont talk about her any more if youd rather not. We indeed! cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Dont let me hear the name again! I wont indeed! said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.

When I was but thirteen or so
I went into a golden land,
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi,
Took me by the hand.
My father died, my brother too,
They passed like fleeting dreams,
I stood where Popocatapetl
In the sunlight gleams.
I dimly heard the master’s voice
And boys far-off at play,
Chimborazo, Cotoani
Had stolen me away
I walked in a great golden dream
To and fro from school
Shining Popocatapetl
The dusty streets did rule.
I walked home with a gold dark boy
And never a word I’d say,
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi
Had taken my speech away
I gazed entranced upon his face
Fairer than any flower
O shining Popocatepetl
It was thy magic hour:
The houses, people, traffic seemed
Thin, fading dreams by day,
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi
They had stolen my soul away

to Count Dracula’s castle in Romania comes to believe that his host is

living a secret life. 
8 May
I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could
not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the
window, and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand
on my shoulder, and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, ‘Good
morning. ’ I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since
the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me. In
starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment.
Having answered the Count’s salutation, I turned to the glass again
to see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for
the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But
there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole room behind
me was displayed, but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself.

This was startling, and coming on the top of so many strange

things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness
which I always have when the Count is near. But at the instant I
saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over
my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to
look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his
eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a
grab at my throat.

`Take care,' he said, 'take care how you cut yourself. It is more dangerous than you think in this country' Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on, 'And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!' And opening the window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving pot, which is fortunately of metal. When I went into the dining room, breakfast was prepared, but I could not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests. But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I 

explored further. Doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit. The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner! 

I’d rather be a sparrow than a snail.
Yes I would.

If I only could,

I surely would.

I’d rather be a hammer than a nail.
Yes I would.

If I only could,

I surely would.

Chorus

Away, I’d rather sail away,

Like a swan that’s here and gone.
A man gets tied up to the ground,
He gives the world

Its saddest sound,

Its saddest sound.

I’d rather be a forest than a street.

Yes I would.

If I only could,

I surely would.

I’d rather feel the earth beneath my feet,
Yes I would.

If I only could,

I surely would.

When the gong sounds at ten in the morning and I walk to school by
our lane,

Every day I meet the hawker crying, ‘Bangles, crystal bangles! ’

There is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must take, no
place he must go to, no time when he must come home.

I wish I were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying, ‘Bangles,
crystal bangles! ’

When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school,

I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging
the ground.

He does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes with the dust, Nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or gets wet. I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with nobody to stop me from digging. 
Just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to bed, I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and down. The lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands Like a giant with one red eye in its head. 
The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at his side, and never once goes to bed in his life. I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night, chasing the shadows with my lantern.
