Juan Manuel Fangio (24 June 191 1—17 July 1995), nicknamed El Maestro (the master) and El  l Chueco (the bow-legged one), was an Argentinian racing—car driver who dominated the ﬁrst  l decade of Formula One racing. r l From an early age he neglected his studies to pursue auto mechanics. In 1938 he entered r his ﬁrst national event, competing in a Ford V8. In 1940,   l he competed with a Chevrolet to win the Grand Prix  [ International Championship, and thereafter devoted his l time to the Argentine Turismo Carretera, becoming g its champion and successfully defending his title a  2 year later. He achieved further success competing   in Europe in the late 19405.  i  l     During the 195 Os Fangio won ﬁve Formula One World Drivers’ Championships — a record ? which stood for 46 years until beaten by Michael  Schumacher — with four different teams (Alfa  Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes—Benz and Maserati).  This feat has never been repeated. Furthermore, his record-breaking four wins in the Argentine Grand Prix earned Fangio the status of the only Argentine driver to have won on home soil. Regarded by many as one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time, his winning percentage of 46% (having won 24 of the 52 Formula One races he entered) is the highest ever.  Fangio became the honorary president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina in 1987, a post he retained until his death in 1995. A museum dedicated to him stands in the neighbourhood in which he was born and in 2011, on the centenary of his birth, tributes were paid around the world to remember his legacy.


Some regard Juan Manuel Fangio as the greatest racing driver ever. He set records that  l are unlikely ever to be beaten. He began his career in races thousands of miles long across _ § rough roads in South America. Only later in life, when he was in his forties, did he turn ; to Formula One and become equally successful there, winning i his ﬁrst title in 1951. He proved his observation and multitasking skills in Monaco in 1950, when he avoided ploughing into the wreckage of an invisible crash scene on the harbour road by noticing that the crowd were all looking at some thing around the corner and not at him, even though he was leading.  Afterwards he said, ‘I was lucky. There had been a similar accident in 1936 and I happened to see a photograph of it the day before the race. As I came out of the chicane, I was aware of something different about the crowd — and then I remembered the photograph and braked as hard as I could. ’  Formula One history was made by Fangio in the 1957 German Grand Prix, where he produced probably the greatest racing performance ever. It took place at the I Nurburgring, the 14—mile track through the Eifel mountains which is considered to be the most challenging race circuit ever devised. Fangio became world champion for the ﬁfth time and retired, aged 47, at the end of that racing season. He returned home to his birthplace, Balcarce, in order to manage a Mercedes car dealership. He was subsequently appointed president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina in 1974. He occasionally returned to Europe in later life to demonstrate his former racing cars. He also made a trip to the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix, where he shared the podium
with fellow Latin-American racer Ayrton Senna a year before the latter’s death in a crash
into the barrier in the San Marino Grand Prix. Senna revered Fangio as his inspiration
and became a triple F1 champion in emulation of Fangio, of whom he said: ‘What he
did in his time is something that was an example of professionalism, of courage, of style
and as a man, a human being. Every year there is a winner of the championship, but not
necessarily a world champion. I think Fangio is the example of a true world champion.’
Fangio died two years later in 1995, at the age of 84.

The bike was new to me, and of course
I had to pay some attention to how it
went. The handlebars were stiff, but apart
from that it seemed a very fine machine,
and I made up my mind to really make
the other kids sit up and take notice.
There was no other bike at school
that had a yellow frame, so that
was something. Legs Hope came
zooming up from behind me. 
‘That yours?’ he said, looking at 
my bike. Legs had had his bike a

couple of years, and his knees came right up past his handlebars as
he pedalled.

‘That’s right,’ I said. ‘The very latest. My father says it is the best
bike that money can buy.’

Legs rode alongside me in order to get a close look, and on the
slight turn he had to make, one of his handlebars caught his knee.
His bike leapt as the front wheel skidded and he flopped sideways
off the seat and the next second he and his machine were bang on
the road in a beautiful gutzer. I pulled up a few yards ahead and
looked back. Legs was all tangled up in his bike. He wasn’t hurt,
of course. He stood up and dragged his bike with him, gave it a
couple of kicks, and was back on in a jifiy. He rode on, and his
monkey face was serious.

‘I’ll have to hit my old man up for a new bike,’ he said. ‘I’m
getting too big for a boy’s bike. What I need is a man’s bike.’

Well, Legs was the same age as myself, and I could tell that what
he said was supposed to be a smack in the eye for me, as his bike
was the same size as mine.

‘It’s your legs, not the bike.’

No sooner had I said that when he swerved out to the middle
of the road and the front wheel of his bike bounced into a pothole
and the back wheel slid in some loose gravel. Down he went again
in another beautiful gutzer. There was a clutter and yell from Legs
and he turned right over on the road with the bike on top of him.
He thrashed around in an awful rage, the bike wheels spinning in
mid-air and his legs waving like long peasticks. I stopped again and

watched him as he pulled himself out from underneath, jerked his
bike up, gave it a couple more kicks, and dusted himself off. His
face was red as a beetroot and he was puffing.

I didn’t laugh as much as I could have, though I managed a fair

amount of giggling.

‘I’d like to be around when you try to ride a man’s bike,’ I told him.

Well, he simply squealed as he jumped on his bike. ‘I’ll show
you, Sullivan,’ he shouted. ‘I’ll mow you down. I’ll run you down
and kill you.’

I took off with a couple of metres start on him, as I saw that he
was going to try to crash his bike into mine. I had to stand up on the
pedals and pump my legs like a madman to keep ahead of him. Legs
was a tough customer when he was worked up, and he wouldn’t have
cared if he had smashed both our bikes to smithereens. Over my
shoulder I saw his knees absolutely jumping up and down behind
his handlebars so fast they were only a bony blur, and he was leaning
between them glaring at me. I really understood how he felt, his pride
having taken a knock. Anyway, he chased me all the way to school, and

rather than stop at the gates I kept right on going, steering around a bunch of kids, and on to the playground. Legs followed. The grass slowed us down, yet our speed was still cracking as we reached the end of the playground and I cut off to the left behind the school building and back down the other side. We must have circled the school two or three times, and though I was some distance ahead of him now, I was beginning to worry whether Legs would ever give up chasing me. Then, passing the front of the school again I heard a loud voice I recognised, and there, on the front steps, was Sister Angela, with a wild face. I jammed on my brakes. Legs came around the side of the building going like fury. He saw Sister standing there and, a funny thing, he never did take his eyes off her. She looked at him and he looked right back as though he had suddenly gone off into a trance or something. He didn't finish his turn around the corner. He kept on going on, not even slowing down, till he and the bike disappeared into the hedge. The last thing I saw of him he was still goggling at Sister. Then came a tearing and wrenching, and the hedge shook for a couple of hundred metres along the roadside, as though it had been hit by a truck, and then there was complete silence. Legs had simply disappeared, that's all. Except for a few broken twigs and one or two leaves drifting around in the air, you couldn't even see where he had been. He didn't make a sound. I knew he must be just lying there in the middle of the hedge with his bike, wondering how the blazes he was going to explain it all away. `Are you all right?' Sister Angela called out. `Oh, yes, Sister,' said Legs from out of the hedge. 'Quite all right, thank you.' Then she turned to me and said, 'Jimmy Sullivan, you help him out of there, tidy up the hedge after you, and the both of you will stay in after school for half an hour.'

Birds of a feather The waiting room looks like any other hospital waiting room, but the patients are all wearing leather hoods and sitting on perches covered with artificial grass. Each year, 5,000 falcons are treated at the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital, which is located just a few kilometres outside the city and has a staff of 65 experts. It was the first and is the largest falcon hospital, and treats falcons from all over the Emirates and the Gulf states, keeping them in peak condition for hunting. The falcon is the national bird of the Emirates, and hunting with falcons is a long standing tradition in the Arab world, going back 2,000 years. Almost every Arab family has at least one falcon; the pure white females are the most sought after and most highly prized. Hunting with falcons is actually banned in the UAE and nowadays they are used for sport or entered for beauty contests only, because the indigenous prey species were being wiped out in the region. For hunting trips the falconers go to Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Africa, China and Russia. The Gulf's nomadic Bedouin tribes used falcons to hunt, but today most birds are bred in captivity, and they command high prices of several thousand dollars. Their owners are devoted to them, and regard them as part of their family as well as part of their culture. They see the birds as majestic looking, fascinating and beautiful, with individual characters. Falcons do not present symptoms of disease until they are extremely sick and it is hard for the owner to detect an ailing bird. The hospital therefore conducts regular check ups on falcons several times a year. They can keep up to 150 birds as in patients, and there is a boarding facility for when owners are away on business or vacation. They trim claws, polish beaks and glue back in missing feathers — necessary for flight balance — as well as treat disease. Research on falcons is also being undertaken by the hospital, and vets and world renowned avian specialists come to study the breed. Since 2006 the hospital has treated other bird species too, everything that has wings, from canaries to ostriches. 

It took a wing, a prayer and some very special goggles to make an extraordinary flight through a mountain last week. As he hurtled towards the rock face at 120 kph, Jeb Corliss suddenly realised that something was going badly wrong. He was zooming in from two kilometres away, flying with nothing but an aerodynamic wingsuit to hold him aloft, and the gap ahead through which he hoped to swoop looked impossibly small. It was just 30 metres wide and 12 metres high, and Corliss could see that he wasn't going to make it. A smoke canister attached to his foot had malfunctioned and thrown him off his glide path. He was too low. Satellite navigation data being beamed into his high-tech goggles showed he was on course to smash into the sheer rock face below the cave entrance. 
'It was horrifying', he said last week. He had only seconds to abort his flight by opening his parachute. 'And I knew that once I had, there wasn't going to be anywhere to land. I really thought I was going to be quite badly bashed up: He opened the chute and spotted a small clearing in the jungle on the mountain slopes, where a landslide had ripped up the trees. It was hair-raisingly steep but his only hope. For a moment last weekend it looked as if Corliss' bid to fly through the 'Gate of Heaven' in Tianmen Mountain, China, was doomed. But he made it down safely and was plucked off the mountainside by a rescue team. He was physically intact and determined to try again. As he ascended again to 2000 metres in a helicopter, even Corliss, a seasoned base jumper and wingsuit flyer, struggled to control the feeling 

 ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,—While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door; Only this and nothing more.' 
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
Eagerly I wished the morrow vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore, For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore: Nameless here for evermore. 
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating "Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door, Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door: This it is and nothing more.' 
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, `Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you here I opened wide the door Darkness there and nothing more. 
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore?' This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, lenore:' Merely this and nothing more. 
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. `Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore; Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore: "Tis the wind and nothing more.' 
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door, Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door: Perched, and sat, and nothing more. 
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it woren Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no craven, 
 
In motoring, we have gone the opposite way from most inventions, which start from a practical need and gradually become safer and more stylish. Cars have become less safe and stylish, in the pursuit of speed. I present to you the Ariel Atom 300, the scariest car, ever. Waiting for the immobiliser light to go out as you wave your keyless fob under the dash to get this crazy car going, goosebumps will appear in places you never thought possible. The 100 kph acceleration time of 2.9 seconds will do everything in its power to tear your clothes off you. The Ariel Atom achieves this tasty little party trick by not having doors. It has no roof, windscreen, rear-view mirror or body panels either, for that matter. Instead, it has an external tubular framework, a little like a crustacean shell. Yet instead of protecting the soft tissues of its occupants, the exoskeleton is wide open for a force-nine gale to howl through the framework and up your trouser leg. I'd listened to any tidbits of advice offered by those insane enough to have already braved the 300bhp version of the Atom on the road. Firstly, they said, wear a long-sleeve top and full-length trousers and a helmet. Leave first gear alone too, I was told, so I did. Don't be too silly in second gear, either. So I wasn't. Entering my first roundabout in third gear, I planted the throttle 
to take my first stab at heroism, only to suddenly find myself facing in an unfamiliar direction, at a rather peculiar angle — and still accelerating. Truth known, every time I drove the nutty, over-powered Ariel, I sighed with relief when I was parked again, in neutral, ignition off, 4-point harness unbuckled, and a metre away from the car. I'd made it back, alive. It may take speed bumps and rough roads in its stride, but it sure doesn't look like a road car. With its skeletal construction, lacking in any sense of logic, the Atom is a loony proposition — and this one is loonier than most, fitted with an optional racing supercharger. With rear wheel drive, and engine slung out the back, the Atom bomb is somewhat rapid. Fudge your gear timing and you'll hit 100 kph in a smidgen over three seconds. A top speed of 250 kph is a finger click away, and so is the likelihood of seeing another day; the Atom is not the most stable automobile in the handling stakes, so be very wary. Under acceleration, the Atom's front-end becomes alarmingly light and loses steering grip, which results in you and whoever was mad enough to allow you to blag them into the passenger seat being fired off in random directions. Definitely a little unsafe; but then again, you might as well go out with a bang. 

I was enjoying an evening with some friends when one of them challenged me to design a plane in the shape of a cockerel. So I took a napkin and sketched it out on the spot. Why not? It was a completely mad idea, which is why I liked it! Roosters rarely fly, so no one could say mine was not lifelike! Most people, when they design an aeroplane, think about boring things like aerodynamics. For me, the paint scheme was much more important. And, of course, it had to look like a rooster. If it could fly safely despite the shape, so much the better. In order to get the rooster's head, I had to make the engine stick up and out at the end of a nice curved neck ... no one has ever made such a ridiculous design for a plane, I think. But how the bambini love it! They expect it to make cock-a-doodle-doo noises — so it does! I have a loudspeaker built into its talons well, wheels and I have a DVD player in the cockpit — what an appropriate name! — with 15 different kinds of cockerel calls to blast out as I go. Although I did my best to make the shape of the plane look like a male chicken, in truth it was nothing like the bird until my brilliant friend Giuliano Basso took over 

the painting. He was inspired by a little-known painting of two cockerels by the Italian naive artist Antonio Ligabue. The feathers in that painting are of such fabulous colours and texture — that's how he brought my wonderful Aerogallo to life. Look at it! It's a unique work of art, and the children laugh. That's what it's all about, making children laugh. All the serious pilots who saw it laughed at my magnificent plane, and refused absolutely to go up in it. Fortunately, I then met Daniele Beltrame, an intrepid air-man who has much more imagination than sense! He agreed to take my Aerogallo into the air for its maiden flight. So, finally, on 26 December 2011, at the tiny airfield of Nervesa in my native Italy, the Aerogallo 'flapped its wings' and took to the sky. It flew like a bird! I take it to all the airshows in Italy, and now it's also famous all over the world, thanks to the internet, and people beg me to bring it to their displays, so their children can see the 'Flying Rooster', and the madman who designed it.
