About 2300 years ago, a man named Peten—Amun (Ptn—’lmn) died in the town of Akhnim in Upper Egypt. Today, a lifelike model of his head and face is on display in the foyer of this museum. According to the hieroglyphics on his cofﬁn, he was probably a minor priest. Scientists believe he was about 60 years old and might have died from old age or an age—related illness.
The reconstruction of the head of Peten-Amun was done in 1990 by Doctor Bill Aulsebrook, a specialist in facial reconstruction. He became fascinated with the challenge of reconstructing the face of someonewho lived thousands of years ago! A CAT scan was used to create a three—dimensional model and then Dr Aulsebrook was able to build up the shape of the face around it. The result is a model of what Peten—Amun is thought to have looked like.
Last week, archaeologists working in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt announced they had uncovered two mummies. One of the mummies was found in a cofﬁn while the other was lying on the ground. According to archaeologists, the simple tomb indicates that the mummies were not particularly important people, but other clues suggest that they were.
Firstly, the mummies were found in the royal burial area. Secondly, the mummy that was on the ground was placed in the position used to show royalty with the left arm crossed over the chest and the ﬁst clenched. Scientists are puzzled about who it could be. Some believe that she was a servant, while others have a theory that it is the body of Queen Hatshepsut, a powerful pharaoh who ruled about 3500 years ago.
Professor Able, leader of the excavation, says, “We will continue working in the area until we ﬁnd clues that will help us solve this mystery”.


A young treasure hunter found a gold pendant worth over £2 million when trying out his dad’s metal detector! Three-year-old James was with his dad scanning the earth when, as he put it, “It went beep, beep, beep”. His dad said it was beginner’s luck. “He got a buzz after just ﬁve minutes. It was his ﬁrst time. I’ve been doing this as a hobby for 15 years and I’ve never found anything!” Experts believe the rare piece of jewellery dates back to the 1500s. “James was so excited to ﬁnd ‘treasure’ but he has no idea how valuable it is”, his dad said. According to James, “We didn’t have a map because only pirates have treasure maps”.
