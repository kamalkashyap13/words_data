Living underground   Living underground requires a seismic psychological shift. One has to plan every action. however small and seemingly insigniﬁcant. Nothing is innocent. Everything is questioned. You cannot be yourself; you must fully inhabit whatever role you have assumed.  I became a creature of the night. I would keep to my hideout during the day, and emerge to do my work when it became dark. I operated mainly from johannesburg, but I would travel as necessary. I stayed in empty ﬂats, in people's houses, wherever I could be alone and inconspicuous. Although I am a gregarious person, I love solitude even more. I welcomed the opportunity to  be by myself, to plan, to think, to plot. But one can have too much solitude.  I was terribly lonesome for my wife and family.

The key to being underground is to be invisible. As a leader, one often seeks prominence; as an outlaw, the opposite is true. When  underground I did not walk as tall or stand as straight. I spoke more softly, with less clarity and distinction. I was more passive, more unobtrusive; I did not ask for things but let people tell me what to do. I did not shave or cut my hair. My most frequent  was as a chauffeur, chef or a ‘garden boy’. I would wear the blue overalls of the field-worker and often wore round, rimless glasses known as Mazzawatee tea-glasses. I had a car and I wore a chauffeurs cap with my overalls. The pose of chauffeur was convenient because I could travel under the pretext of driving my master’s car.  During those early months, when there was a warrant for my arrest and I was being pursued by the police, my outlaw existence caught the imagination of the press. Articles claiming that I had been here and there were on the front pages. Roadblocks were instituted all over the country, but the police repeatedly came up empty-handed.  I travelled secretly about the country: 1 was with Muslims in the Cape, with sugar-workers in Natal, with factory workers in Port Elizabeth I moved through townships in different parts of the country, attending secret meetings at night. I would pop up here and there to the annoyance of the police and to the delight of the people. There were many wild and inaccurate stories about my experiences underground. People love to embellish tales of daring. I did have a number of narrow escapes, however, which no one knew about.

Born in Burma (also known as Myanmar) in 1945,
Aung San Suu Kyi was the only daughter of Aung San,
considered to be the father of modern-day Burma. She
attended high school in New Delhi and then studied 
philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University.
She moved to New York for graduate studies, where 
she worked as a hospital volunteer, helping patients
learn to read. Following her marriage to Briton Michael
Aris, she went to the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan and
worked in the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also
writing several books about her country. Her two sons,
born in the UK in 1973 and 1977, were initiated into
monkhood in a traditional Buddhist ceremony.
The suppression by the military rulers of  
mass uprising in Burma made Suu Kyi write 
protest letter calling for democratic government
of the country. In 1988 she formed a league 
to carry out non-violent civil disobedience 
and toured the country making speeches. 
She vowed to serve her country, even at 
the risk of death, as her father and mother 
had done, and continued her campaign 
despite the threats, arrests and killings 
of her followers. She was placed under
house arrest with her sons in 1989,

without charge or trial, and went on hunger strike on
behalf of students arrested with her. Despite her detention,
her National League for Democracy party won 82% of
parliamentary seats in the election in 1990, but the rulers
did not recognise the result.

After receiving various human rights prizes, she was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 but was unable
to collect it in Oslo as she was still detained, and refused
to buy her freedom at the expense of withdrawing from
politics. She announced that she would use the prize money
to provide health and education facilities for the Burmese
people. I-ler popularity continued to grow, at home and
abroad. Suu Kyi discouraged tourists from visiting Burma
and businesses from investing in the country until it was
free. Her husband died in 1999; he had not seen her since
1995 and was refused permission to visit her one last time.
She knew that if she left the country she would not be
allowed to return.

Now, after spending 15 years of the past 21 under house
arrest, Suu Kyi is at liberty. She has recently been elected to
the Burmese parliament and travelled to Europe, where in
June 2012 she finally made her acceptance speech for the
Nobel Peace Prize, two decades late. She believes that she
survived her ordeal because of the BBC world radio service
which allowed her to stay informed and feel in touch with the
rest of the world and the lives of other people - and through
playing the piano. She says, ‘When I was under house arrest I
thought that what I wanted to be most of all was a composer,
because I thought then I could compose music and this
could reach out to people all over the world, regardless of
what language they knew or didn’t know.’ She believes that
resolving conflict is not about condemnation but about
discovering and solving the roots of the conflict.

After school was let out in the early afternoon, I waited with allzthe:
other first-graders by the school gate. One by one they were greeted
and led away by their anxiously hovering mothers. Eventually, v
I was the only one left. Nobody had come for me. The metal
gate slowly clanged shut behind me as I watched my classmates
disperse, each clutching her mother’s hand and eagerly recounting
the adventures of her first day at school. After a long time, I peered
through a crack into the deserted playground. Not a person was
in sight. Cautiously, I pushed against the massive iron gate. It was
firmly locked. Trembling with fear, I realised that nobody was
coming to pick me up. Too embarrassed to knock or draw attention
to myself, I walked out tentatively into the Shanghai streets. Surely,
if I tried hard enough, I would remember the way home.
It was a beautiful, sunny afternoon. At first I wandered
along a wide, straight road lined with tall, leafy trees. Motor
cars, trams, rickshaws, pedicabs and bicycles whizzed by. I
kept walking but dared not cross the road, glancing briefly
at the open-fronted stores overhung with colourful, upright,
bilingual signboards. I turned a corner and now the pavements
seethed with people and noise and commotion: labourers
shouldering heavy loads on bamboo poles; hawkers selling
toys, crickets in cages, fans, cold tea, candies, meat-filled
buns, spring rolls, tea-eggs and fermented bean curd; stalls



and booths offering services such as hair-cuts, shaves, dental
care, letter-writing, extraction of ear wax; beggars banging tin
cups and chanting for a handout. Except for me, everyone was
striding along purposefully, going somewhere. Everyone had a
destination; I must have walked for miles and miles. But where
was I?
Should I enter a shop and ask for directions? But I didn’t know
my home address. What should I say? Should I approach that
kindly old Storekeeper smiling at
me from the doorway of his antique 7
shop and tell him, ‘Please, sir, I
want to go home’? But where was
my home? I
I walked past a bustling,
brightly lit dim sum shop. Such
a wonderful aroma was wafting a
through the door! Through the
plate-glass window, I saw roast
ducks, soya-sauce chickens, and
hunks of glistening meat hanging 
from hooks. There was a young 
chef wielding his cleaver and deftly
chopping a duck into bite-sized
pieces on a wooden block. Wouldn’t 
it be heavenly to be given a slice 
of meat? But that might be too , 
much to hope for. I would be qu1te 
content With a piece of bone to
chew on. As I salivated, I imagined 
the taste of the food sliding down 
my throat. Breakfast seemed such a 
long time ago!
