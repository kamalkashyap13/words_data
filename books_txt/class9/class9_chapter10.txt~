At the but there was nothing to do but wait.

At last they heard the throbbing of the drum and the long eerie
blasts on the trumpet which meant the medicine-man was near. He
was preceded by the little dwarf cow that he dressed in tassels and
necklaces of beads, with an embroidered cloth covering her hump.

He raised his hand in the air as he marched over the log on the
creek and gave another long blast on his trumpet which was made of
bone. The bone of what? the girls wondered uneasily.

Lila came running out of the house to speak to the medicine-man.

‘My mother is ill. She has been ill for a long time. Now she
has fever too. Have you any medicine for fever? Have you any
medicine for making her strong? She is so weak,’ Lila explained.

‘Slowly, slowly, daughter. What is the hurry? First, I must have
water for my cow - fresh well water. Next, I must have grass for
her. Fresh, tender grass. Then I will come and see your mother. ’

So that was how things had to be done. After the cow had been
looked after, he too demanded attention. Lila had to heat a tumbler
of tea for him which he sipped, sitting on a string cot under the
frangipani tree while the girls stood before him and told him how W
their mother was growing weaker and weaker, refusing to eat and
unable to get up at all. ‘And now she is hot with fever, ’ Lila wailed
suddenly, no longer able to speak calmly
The man looked at her with his sharp, bright eyes,
understanding how it was with her. He got up quickly and
started being very busy. To their surprise he did not go in to
see their mother as they had expected he would. Instead, he
ordered them to build a fire on the threshold of the hut. Once
it had started crackling and smoking, he flung in packets of

flowers that he took from a bag slung over the cow’s back - jasmine
and marigold, hibiscus and frangipani.

When the fire had died down, he poked at it with a long stick,
scattering the ashes so that they cooled. Then he scooped them
up into his cupped hand and asked for water. They brought him a
tumbler and he poured a little into the palm of his hand and With
one thumb and forefinger he mixed it with the ash. Then he went in
to see their mother at last.

The man told her to open her mouth and put out her tongue,
which she did, and on it he dropped some of the ash. ‘Eat, sister, ’ he
said. ‘Holy ash, purified ash. It will purify you within. It will drive
away the demons that create the fever. Swallow.’ He kept rolling
small balls of ash between his fingers and dropping them into her
mouth, making her swallow them. Then he clapped his hands
together, broke into the loud recitation of prayers, and walked out.

The girls followed, dazed.

Lifting his trumpet, the medicine-man blew a long blast on it; he
stared down into their faces and looked very fierce. ‘So? ’ he shouted
at them. ‘What do you do now? Stare at my face? Got nothing to
give me but your stares? Think I can fill my stomach with that?
Think I do it all for free? ’

Lila shook herself guiltily and ran into the hut, knowing there
was no money But she came out with something in her hand - the
ring their mother used to wear when she was well and that she
had taken off and kept behind the mirror on the shelf now that
she was ill. It was of silver - rather blackened and twisted now,
but still silver. The girls gave a gasp of astonishment, but the man
merely snatched it out of Lila’s hand, tucked it away into one of
his pouches and marched off towards his cow without a word of
thanks.

My mum drove me the 60 kilometres to the heliport at Rotorua. We
had to report by 7am, so that meant a very early start! But I hardly

attend an orientation briefing where they explained the services
they offered. Here in NZ many farms are up in the mountains and if
it’s really hard for vets to get there fast enough when there’s an
emergency. So  has a team of highly experienced vets on 
standby, and when the call comes, out they go!
Actually, there were no callouts today, so I was able to meet the
team and begin to understand how it all worked. They let me sit in
the helicopter!

The callout came before 8am. We ran to the helicopter, the pilot,
the vet, the loadmaster and me. I was taking the place of the flying
nurse. It was a big responsibility. You don’t know where you’re
going until you’re in the air. It all comes through on the radio from

the control room. There was a cow in labour on a high farm and
they couldn’t deliver the calf. If you don’t get there quickly enough
the calf can get tangled up in the umbilical cord (IGCSE Biology!)
and asphyxiate, so it’s always a run to the helicopter and a rush to
get into the air as fast as we can.

The loadmaster sits next to the pilot and they have to identify
the farm from the air, which wasn’t easy - there are so many up
there - but somehow they managed it. We landed in a field next
to the house, and three of us ran in while the pilot stayed in the
helicopter. The farmer was waiting anxiously and took us to a
barn. Jo, the vet, immediately took over, giving us all. instructions.
Helping a cow to calve turns out not to be a very subtle process
she stuck her hand inside the cow, and after a while attached a
rope. The loadmaster and I pulled on the rope like a tug of war
while Jo coaxed from within, and a minute later the calf plopped

out! The calf was soon staggering around and we were back in the
helicopter and on our way home, feeling we’d done a good job: a
happy, groggy calf, a relieved mom and a very relieved farmer.

This was quite a boring day. No calls at all. I was itching to be flying
into the mountains again, but instead I spent the time checking the
medical supplies and polishing the helicopter. A helicopter is very
big and there’s an awful lot of metal to polish! It’s not all drama like
on TV, but I hope tomorrow will be a bit more lively
Thursday
Today was pretty much a re-run of Tuesday - it’s calving season and
apparently it’s common for the farmer to need help with difficult
births. This time it was over before we got there, and everything
was fine, but you never know, and the team always responds to a
call just in case.
Friday
My last day. I was hoping for a really ‘good’ callout, and I was not
disappointed! Apparently, a bunch of lambs had fallen into a gully
in the mountains - that’s the trouble with lambs, where one goes all
the others will follow, no matter how crazy.

We were flying over really wild mountains. There was no way we
could land anywhere. I couldn’t see how we would ever even find
them, but then I saw a green flare rising into the sky like a reversed
comet, and we saw a group of men with a 4 x 4. This is where it got
really scary The loadmaster strapped Jo into a harness, and then she
sat in the open door of the helicopter - and jumped out! But the winch
is strong and these guys really know what they’re doing. She was
lowered slowly into the gully, while the pilot hovered really skilfully,
frighteningly close to a cliff-face. I could see Jo scoop up a struggling
lamb and tie it into the tiny stretcher she had, and then another.

She had to go down three times before they were all rescued and in
the helicopter. As soon as she was out of the harness, Jo said ‘They all
need checking out. Take them all back.’ So I helped her to look after
the lambs, holding them as she sedated them, during the short flight
back. She took them into the medical facility at the back of the hangar,
but she said she thought they’d all recover once the shock. had passed.

And that was it. I had to say goodbye and go home. But one
thing I now know for sure: this is the only job I want to do!

This highway I know,

the only way into the city

These are the sides of coarse grasses
where the schoolboys stumble in early morning
wet-staining their white shoes.

This is the way the city is fed

men, machines,

flushed out of their short dreams
and suburban holes

to churn down this waiting gullet.
They flow endlessly this way

to the narrow glare of noon

and evenings slow closing.

The children are at the loom of another world.

Their braids are oiled and black, their dresses bright.
Their assorted heights would make a melodious chime
They watch their flickering knots like television.

As the garden of Islam grows, the bench will be raised.
Then they will lace the dark-rose veins of the tree-tops.
The carpet will travel in the merchant’s truck.

It will be spread by the servants of the mosque.

Deep and soft, it will give when heaped with prayer.
The children are hard at work in the school of days.
From their fingers the colours of all-that-will-be fly
and freeze into the frame of all-that-was.

I like working near a door. I like to have my work-bench 

close by, with a locker handy.

Here, the cold creeps in under the big doors, and in the 

summer hot dust swirls, clogging the nose. When the 

big doors open to admit a lorry-load of steel
conditions do not improve. Even so, I put up with it

and wouldn’t care to shift to another bench, away from 

the big doors. 

As one may imagine this is a noisy place with smoke

rising, machines thumping and thrusting, people
kneading, shaping, and putting things together.

Because I am nearest to the big doors I am the farthest

away from those who have to come down to shout 
instructions in my ear.

I am the first to greet strangers who drift in through the 

open doors looking for work. I give them as much
information as they require, direct them to the offices,

and acknowledge the casual recognition that one 
worker signs to another.

I can always tell the look on the faces of the successful

ones as they hurry away. The look on the faces of the

unlucky I know also, but cannot easily forget.
