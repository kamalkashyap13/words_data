There now remains for me to relate to you the story of my sixth brother, whose name was Schacabac. Like the rest of us, he inherited a hundred silver drachmas from our father, which he thought was a large fortune, but through ill-luck, he soon lost it  all, and was driven to beg. As he had a smooth tongue and good manners, he really did very well in his new profession, and he devoted himself specially to making friends with the servants in big houses, so as to gain access to their masters.  One day he was passing a splendid mansion, with a crowd of servants lounging in the courtyard. He thought that from the appearance of the house it might yield him a rich harvest, so he entered and enquired to whom it belonged.  ‘My good man, where do you come from?’ replied the servant. ‘Can’t you see for yourself that it can belong only to someone famed for their liberality and generosity?‘ My brother, hearing this, asked the porters, of whom there were several, if they would give him alms. They did not refuse, but told him politely to go in, and speak to the master himself.

My brother thanked them for their courtesy and entered the building, which was so large that it took him some time to reach the apartments of the master. At last, in a room richly decorated with paintings, he saw an old man with a long white beard, sitting on a sofa, who received him with such kindness that my brother was emboldened to make his petition.  ‘My lord,‘ he said, ‘you behold in me a poor man who only lives by the help of persons as rich and as generous as you.’  Before he could proceed further, he was stopped by the astonishment shown by the master. ‘Is it possible, ’ he cried, ‘that while I am in Baghdad, a man like you should be starving? That is a state of things that must at once be put an end to! Never shall it be said that I have abandoned you, and I am sure that you, on your part, will never abandon me.‘  'My lord,’ answered my brother, ‘I swear that l have not broken my fast this whole day.


What, you are dying of hunger? exclairrmd the master; "Here,
if: slave; bring water, that we may wash our hands before meat!’ No
a? slave appeared, but my brother remarked that the master did not
fail to rub his hands as if the water had been poured over them.
Then he said to my brother, ‘Why don’t you wash your hands
too? ’ and Schacabac, supposing that it was a joke on the part of the
E , master (though he could see none himself), drew near, and imitated
T his motion.
3- When the master had done rubbing his hands, he raised his
a voice, and cried, ‘Set food before us at once, we are very hungry. ’ No
5, food was brought, but the master pretended to help himself from a
dish, and carry a morsel to his mouth, saying as he did so, ‘Eat, my
5 friend, eat, I entreat. Help yourself as freely as if you were at home!
5 For a starving man, you seem to have a very small appetite. ’
‘Excuse me, my lord,’ replied Schacabac, imitating his gestures as
before, ‘I really am not losing time, and I do full justice to the repast.’
‘How do you like this bread? ’ asked the master. ‘1 find it
particularly good myself.’
‘Oh, my lord,’ answered my brother, who beheld neither meat
5 , nor bread, ‘never have I tasted anything so delicious!’
i After ordering a variety of dishes (which never came) to be
E placed on the table, and discussing the merits of each one, the
master began to laugh, and embraced him heartily. ‘I have long
E been seeking,’ he exclaimed, ‘a man of your description, and
E henceforth my house shall be yours. You have had the good grace
£5; to fall in with my humour, and to pretend to eat when nothing was
5 there. Now you shall be rewarded by a really good supper.’
E' ‘ Then he clapped his hands, and all the dishes were brought
that they had tasted in imagination before and during the repast,
E as slaves sang and played on various instruments. All the while
Schacabac was treated by the master as a familiar friend, and
g dressed in a garment out of his own wardrobe.

A place which the locals rave about is
‘Satsanga ’, run by a Frenchman who left Paris
15 years ago. Here, locals come in droves to
sit at the small tables in the outdoor courtyard
and feast upon the eclectic fusion of French
ingredients and Indian spices.

Over at the charming Hotel de l'Orient, you
can sup to your heart’s content on prawns in
saffron sauce or, for the sweet-toothed, the
coconut flan with caramel that is as close to
perfection as one can get.

On every street corner there is a food shack
or dhaba waiting to be discovered. Despite
their generally shabby appearance, these small
places serve some of the most authentic and
delicious food around. 0050 meals are prepared
from scratch in front of hungry customers,
as are Mysore bondas (spicy deep-fried
potato cakes).

Sweets and savouries go hand in hand
in South India and are served on special
occasions and as teatime treats for guests.
Shops which sell sweet and savoury snacks
are busy all year round, but the crowds really
descend on them during the Hindu festivals of

Diwali in October and Pongal in January, for
which the festival dish consists of rice cooked
with jaggery (unrefined sugar cane), raisins
and nuts.

Visitors to Puducherry’s frenetic Nellithope
indoor fish market are greeted by the heady
scent of red snappers, sardines, eels, spider
crabs, mackerel and large prawns, all freshly
hauled from the Bay of Bengal. It is here that
you will find South India’s most prized and
versatile fish, the seer fish, which has a texture
similar to tuna.

Another favourite in local households
is a South Indian meat stew consisting of
goat, seasoned with bay leaves, cinnamon,

operate. The market
I most often visit is a
vegetable souk that’s a
convenient ten-minute
walk from my house.
The first time I visited, I couldn’t help but think this is what a real farmers ’ market
must be like. Mountains of vegetables that look as though they have just been picked,
and amazing prices. The kibab - small torpedo-shape balls, pointy on both ends, made
1 from minced meat and fine bngur (cracked wheat) - is a classic preparation across the
Levant, and is famous for its endless variations: with sour cherries or quince; carrots or
pumpkin; yogurt or broth; raw or cooked; fried or baked; boiled or grilled.
Souks are also known for their variety of stuffed vegetables: eggplants, zucchini,
peppers, grape leaves, cabbage leaves, tomatoes, potatoes; I’m sure I’m forgetting a
lot. As of lately, my favorite has been the stuffed Swiss chard leaves. I had them for
the first time a few months ago on a chilly winter afternoon. My grandmother’s sister l
prepared a batch one afternoon for me to try. The stuffed chard leaves looked almost
3 like over-stuffed grape leaves, but with a more pronounced dark green color.
Before we sat down to eat, my grandmother’s sister asked me to mince some garlic;
it’s for the sauce, she said. She added the fragrant garlic bits into a bowl of pearly
white yogurt, sprinkled a small handful of dried mint, and stirred. It looked beautiful.
The specks of bright green mint stood out in the creamy yogurt. As she carried the
pot of stuffed chard leaves to the table she told me this used to be my grandfather’s 3
favorite dish. I took my first bite. I remember I wasn’t very excited. In my mind, it
didn’t seem like anything could compare to the flavor and texture of stuffed grape
leaves. ‘You have to eat it with the yogurt sauce,’ she proclaimed.
I took another bite, this time with the yogurt. Had I been a cartoon character, this
I is when fireworks would be happening in my eyes. The difference is incredible. The E
sauce brings the dish to life. The garlic flavor is intense, but the yogurt helps round
out its sharp edges - it also helps cool the palate.
I practiced making this dish on my own, and I think I finally got it right. I got
excellent reviews from a couple of expert home cooks. This is one of those dishes that
takes time, but is worth every minute of rolling.
