In the beginning, Bear owned Fire. Fire warmed Bear and his people on cold days and it gave themlight when the nights were long and dark. Bear always carried Fire with him.
One day, Bear and his people went to a forest. Bearput Fire down at the edge of the forest, then Bear and his people went deeper and deeper into the forest to look for food.
Fire blazed up happily for a while until it had burned nearly all of its wood. It started to smoke and ﬂicker, then it dwindled down and down. Fire was worried. It was nearly out. “Feed me! Feed me!" shouted Fire. But Bear and his people had wandered deep into the forest,and they did not hear Fire’s cries.
At that moment, Man came walking throughthe forest and saw the small, ﬂickering Fire. “Feed me! Feed me!" cried Fire. “What should I feed you?" Man asked.He had never seen Fire before. “I eat sticks and logs,” Fire replied. Man picked up a stick and gave it to Fire. Fire sent its ﬂames ﬂickering up the side of the stick until the stick started to burn. Man brought more and more sticks and Fire leapt and dancedin delight.
Man warmed himself by the blazing Fire, enjoying the colours of the ﬂames and the hissing sound Fire made as it ate the wood. Man and Fire were very happy together and Man  fed Fire sticks whenever it got hungry. A long time later, Bear and his people came back to the edge of the forest, looking for Fire. Fire was angry when it saw Bear and it jumped and roared at him and drove him away.
So from that day to this, Fire has belonged to Man.

Over 3500 years ago, the Queen of Sheba began to hear strange tales. The traders who came to her African kingdom told tales of a new king. “King Solomon," they said, “is a very wise man.” The queen asked questions about this new king. She watched the traders’ faces in the ﬂickering light of the ﬁres and saw that in the stories they told her about the king, they spoke the truth. “There are already legends about this man, "she said to her closest advisers. “I must meet him so I can decide for myself how wise he is.” She ordered her servants to prepare a train of camels and load them with gifts for the king.

After a few weeks, the queen was ready to set out. Throughout the long journey she rode her own camel. She sat on a silken cushion and was protected from the harsh sunlight by a silken canopy over her head.The journey across the desert was dangerous so many died from thirst for exhaustion. There were also ﬁerce ﬁghts with bandits who wanted to steal the camels.

When King Solomon knew that the queen was coming, he told his servants to polish the ﬂoor of his throne room ﬂoor until it was as shiny as a mirror and to set many lamps to blaze around the walls. The light from the torches reﬂected in the mirror-like ﬂoor so the room was bathed in dancing ﬂames. King Solomon had heard a strange story about the queen. It was said that the beautiful queen had one leg that was hairy like a goat’s and Solomon wanted to know if this was true.
At long last, the queen’s train of camels approached the palace. The king sent torch-bearers out into the desert to meet her so she came to his city in a glittering procession of torchlight. As he led the queen into his court, Solomon glanced down at the ﬂoor. It was true! She did have a hairy leg!
Soon the queen’s leg was forgotten.King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba became good friends and the queen stayed at King Solomon's court for many months.

A monkey and a cat once lived together with an old man. They were good friends.
One evening they were warming themselves by the ﬁre. They could smell the delicious smell of the chest nuts that were roasting in the ﬂames. of the ﬁre.
At last the monkey became so hungry that he tried to pick a chestnut out of the fire. “Ow!” he complained. “That’s too hot! I can’t get it!”

Then he looked slyly at the cat and said, “I have a plan. You are so much braver than me. A bit of pain won’t worry you. If you put your paw into the ﬁre and pull out the chestnuts, we can share them. "The cat liked the monkey so she put her paw into the ﬁre, just as her friend had asked her to do. The cat began pulling the chestnuts out of the ﬁre. But as fast as she pulled them out, the monkey grabbed the mand gobbled them up. After a while the old man picked up the cat and bandaged her burnt paw. “Poor old puss," he said. “I hope you have learned a lesson from this.
