Sophie was walking round the garden, wearing a pair of her mother’s very old sunglasses. They made Sophielook like a panda. They made pinkﬂowers look red and yellow flowers look golden and cabbages look blue.
Sophie walked along the path that ran along the front of the house and peered in through the dining—room window. inside, everything looked very dark. But whatever in the world was that long shadowy thing lying on the ﬂoor?
In the dining room Sophie’s father 5 lay ﬂat on the hard wood—block ﬂoor,l his arms by his sides, and stared gloomily at the ceiling. Sophie peeped round the door.
“Daddy?” she said. "Yes." "Are you all right?" "No." “What’s the matter?” “My back hurts.” “I’m not surprised,” said Sophie. “Lying on that hard old ﬂoor. If you wanted to have a rest, ”Why didn’t you go to bed?” Sophie's father sighed.
“It’s not because I'm lying on the ﬂoor that my back hurts,” he said. “It’s because my back hurts," he said "It's because my back hurts that I'm lying on the floor." "Oh," said Sophie.
Sophie lay down beside her father, her arms by her sides, and stared thoughfully at the ceiling. “Would you like to play agame?” she said. We can play l Spy. You’ll only need to move your eyes. That won’t hurt your back. "Oh all right," said her father. "You start."



Sophie thinks of more and more games to play with her father. Father gets fed up and gets up to escape Sophie. The doctor comes to the house and tells him to lie down again on the hard floor. Sophie is pleased and thinks of more games.

Ruby took one note from her wallet to pay for the bus fare. The bus stopped at Rosalinda’s Gift Shop. In the window was a music box with skating ballerinas. “Isn’t it beautiful, Max?” said Ruby. “Thirsty!” said Max. “You may buy a very, very small lemonade, Max,” said Ruby.

Next door was Candi’s Corner and they sold sweets that were like teeth. Max knew Grandma would love a set of teeth oozing with cherry syrup inside for her birthday. He bought them instead of the lemonade. “Two notes, please,” said Candi. Max wanted to make sure the teeth worked. He put them in. The teeth worked perfectly.  Ruby had to take Max to the launderette. They spent three notes.
"Hungary!" said Max. It was lunchtime. Max ﬁnished off a peanut butter sandwich, two coconut cupcakes and a banana, milkshake. Lunch cost four notes.

They walked all the way back to Rosalinda’s Gift Shop. “l’d like to buy the music box with skating ballerinas for Grandma’s .birthday,” Ruby said to Rosalinda.  “It’s one hundred notes,”  said Rosalinda. Ruby looked in her wallet.


 Max went back to Candi’s Corner. Teeth (with no cherry syrup) were half price. Max bought a set with the last note.

 “Oh no, Max,” said Ruby. “You’ve spent our last note. How are we going to pay for’ the bus home?”  “Grandma will'have to pick us," said Ruby. “I hope she won’t be angry. Grandma was not angry at all.
