‘If anyone has forgotten anything, ’ sail Dorothy, as their heavily laden car drew away from the house and headed for the motorway, ‘say so now, or for ever hold your peace. ’  ‘Will we be in time for the ferry? ’ asked Susan, the youngest of the three children on the back seat.  ‘We shall if we don’t have to go back to  turn off the bathroom tap, ’ sari her mother.  Last year it had been the bathroom tap. The year before that, someone had broken a window just as they were leaving. And the year they went camping, they left a dozen tins of cat food behind for Ollie, but took the tin-opener away with them, to the considerable inconvenience of the neighbours who came in to feed their pet. Holiday departures were always occasions of stress and error. ‘But this year,’ sai_d Dorothy, ‘we seem to have got away without a hitch. Touch wood.’ She tapped the dashboard.  ‘That’s plastic, ’ observed her husband, Adrian, who was driving.  ‘Never mind,’ sa_id_ Dorothy, ‘l’m not superstitious. By the way, what on earth were you doing half an hour ago? I looked out of the front bedroom window and saw you tearing off up the road in the car, and then about ten minutes later I looked out of the back bedroom window and you were in the garden, digging. ’  ‘l’ll tell you later, ’ m Adrian.  ‘That sounds suspicious,’ m his eldest, Jonathan.  ‘What happened, Daddy?’ asked Rosemary, the middle child.  ‘Try and guess,’ ml Adrian. ‘It’ll pass the time on the journey Scene One: man dashes out of house, jumps into car loaded with holiday gear and drives off like a bat out of hell. Scene Two: ten minutes later, same man is observed digging in his back garden. Now what connection could there be between the two events?

Though three men dwell on Flannan Isle
To keep the lamp alight,

As we steer’d under the lee, we caught
No glimmer through the night!

A passing ship at dawn had brought

The news; and quickly we set sail,

To find out what strange thing might ail
The keepers of the deep-sea light.

We stood a moment, still tongue-tied: And each with black foreboding eyed The door, ere we should fling it wide, To leave the sunlight for the gloom: Till, plucking courage up, at last, Hard on each other's heels we passed Into the living-room. 
Yet, as we crowded through the door, We only saw a table, spread For dinner, meat and cheese and bread; But all untouch'd; and no one there: As though, when they sat down to eat, Ere they could even taste, Alarm had come; and they in haste Had risen and left the bread and meat: For on the table head a chair Lay tumbled on the floor. 
We listened but we only heard The feeble cheeping of a bird That starved upon its perch: And, listening still, without a word, We set about our hopeless search. 

Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller, Knocking on the moonlit door; And his horse in the silence champed the grasses Of the forest's ferny floor: And a bird flew up out of the turret, Above the Traveller's head: And he smote upon the door again a second time; `Is there anybody there?' he said. But no one descended to the Traveller; No head from the leaf-fringed sill Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes, Where he stood perplexed and still. But only a host of phantom listeners That dwelt in the lone house then Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight To that voice from the world of men: Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair, That goes down to the empty hall, Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken By the lonely Traveller's call. And he felt in his heart their strangeness, Their stillness answering his cry, While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf, 'Neath the starred and leafy sky; For he suddenly smote on the door, even Louder, and lifted his head Tell them I came, and no one answered, That I kept my word,' he said. Never the least stir made the listeners, Though every word he spake Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house From the one man left awake , they heard his foot upon the stirrup, And the sound of iron on stone, And how the silence surged softly backward, When the plunging hoofs were gone.
