Many schools and colleges employ multiple-choice testing, not only for  entrance tests but for end-of-course examinations. In some countries, such as the USA and former Soviet Union, such tests are virtually the only form of academic evaluation. But multiple-choice tests arouse dramatically differing opinions amongst supporters and critics; the former swear by them, while the latter are resolutely opposed.

Let’s start with what is not disputed. A multiple—choice test is one in which the student is presented with a number of alternative answers — usually between three and ﬁve — and asked to select one — or more than one, according to the rules of the test — which answers the question. It is also agreed by all sides that these tests are easy to mark, as there is one acceptable answer, and no skill or judgement is required by an examiner. Indeed, many multiple-choice answer sheets are optically scanned and marked by computer.

It is for this latter reason that supporters describe these tests as ‘objective’ — the answer is simply right or wrong. It does not depend upon the ability of the student to express himself or herself clearly; it does not depend on how harsh or lenient the marker is; it is not subject to how tired the examiner is or their mood that day. Multiple-choice tests are therefore, say supporters, efﬁcient and fair.

What of the critics? For them, almost everything about multiple—choice tests is anti- educational: they stiﬂe initiative and force students to think alike; they encourage closed minds; they foster the fallacy that there is always a right answer, and only one right answer, to life’s questions. Critics scoff at the idea that true understanding and subtle appreciation can be tested in this way, and ridicule the simplicity of multiple—choice questions with such examples as ‘Was Shakespeare a great writer? Yes/ No / Maybe.’ They also, more tellingly, point out that so—called ‘distractor’ answers, the wrong ones, can mislead unwary candidates, and they claim that students who have been coached in multiple—choice techniques do better in the exam, regardless of their actual level of knowledge, than those who have not.
Research has proved that a candidate will inevitably score 20% if there are ﬁve answers, and 33% if there are only three, by simply circling answer ‘A’ every time. thdamentally, critics say, these tests give the illusion of objectivity only because it is easy to count whether the candidates picked the ‘right’ answer. The questions themselves may be ﬂawed and simplistic, however, so this may not reflect anything of actual value, such as a student’s knowledge, understanding, skill or perception.


Long ago on the Arabian Peninsula, when cities ﬂourished along the major trade routes that stretched across the desert to transport spices, almonds and dates, there ruled in one of those cities a king whose daughter had come of marriageable age.  Three princes of nearby cities came to court her. But the princess 5 looked at them with alarm. One prince was bossy, the second prince was unclean in his habits, and the third suitor was vain.  ‘Father, I beg you, don’t make me marry any of them!’ she cried.  The king loved his daughter, but he didn’t want to offend her suitors and risk angering his neighbouring city-states.  think about it,’ he said. ‘Come back tomorrow.’  The next day, he summoned the three suitors and the princess to his throne room.
‘Each of you is a perfectly worthy suitor for my daughter’s hand,’ he said.

The next day when the three princes arrived to hear which of W them would. be selected, at court stood a very old man. He hobbled on his cane and spoke in a whisper. The three princes repeated wh they thought they deserved the hand of the princess. ‘As far as I’m concemed,’ asserted the king, ‘each of these fine young men has an equal claim to my daughter’s hand. And so," he turned to his guest, ‘I am interested. You come from a faraway land. What is your opinion?’
The old man coughed and cleared his throat. ‘Your Majesty, first allow me to say that it is an honour to be in your court.’ He raised a shaky hand toward the princes. ‘There’s no doubt that eaCh of you brought a wondrous item that saved the life of the princess.

And so I would ask our royal highness. ’ He turned to her. ‘Princess, whom do you wish to marry? ’


The road not taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both

And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better Claim
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that, the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

He’s here in double trust:
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his Virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued against
The deep damnation of his taking-off.
And pity, like a naked newborn babe
Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubim horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself
And falls on the other.

We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honoured me of late, and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Not cast aside so soon.
Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely? From this time,
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Letting ‘I dare not’ wait upon ‘I would,’
Like the poor cat i ’ ?
Prithee, peace.
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.
What beast was’t, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man.
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man.
I thought I had a choice when I was young
and some young me decided what I did
and so became the me that now is sung,
the me from whom all other pasts are hid.
I think I have a choice this very day
and now will be deciding what I do
and so become the me that chose this way,
the me to whom some futures gave no clue.
I think I will have choices still to come
and me to be ‘will claim decisions made
and so remain the me that hears the drum,
the me for whom there comes the last parade.
I hear no drummer but my own and so
no other times and pathways can I know

The Three Princes Long ago on the Arabian Peninsula, when cities flourished along the major trade routes that stretched across the desert to transport spices, almonds and dates, there ruled in one of those cities a king whose daughter had come of marriageable age. Three princes of nearby cities came to court her. But the princess 5 looked at them with alarm. One prince was bossy, the second prince was unclean in his habits, and the third suitor was vain. `Father, I beg you, don't make me marry any of them!' she cried. The king loved his daughter, but he didn't want to offend her suitors and risk angering his neighbouring city-states. 10 `I'll think about it,' he said. 'Come back tomorrow' The next day, he summoned the three suitors and the princess to his throne room. `Each of you is a perfectly worthy suitor for my daughter's hand,' he said. 'Therefore, to make the correct decision I have determined 15 that the three of you must venture into the world for one year and 
a day. Whoever returns with the most xxTynArecnc item Wil my 
daughter's hand in marriage.' The three princes set out together. After travelling for one week they came to a well that was located before a fork in the road, 20 beyond which the road branched into three separate paths. `Obviously, this is where we should part,' stated the first prince. `Don't you think we know that?' said the second prince, wiping his dirty hands on his cloak. `Listen carefully,' the first prince continued. 'One week before we 25 return to the palace, let's all meet at this well to compare what we found.' `I only hope the maidens don't slow me down by falling in love with me,' said the third prince, throwing back his hair. 'It's such a nuisance.' And so the three princes went their separate ways. When the time came to return to the well, each one followed his separate path 30 that led back to the well. `You look a little the worse for wear,' said the first prince to the second. 'I'm fine,' said the second prince, blowing his nose onto his sleeve. 'What did you find?' `Only a crystal ball,' said the first prince, as nonchalantly as he could, 'that shows anything you want to see that's happening anywhere in the world.' The other two were impressed (and a bit worried). Said the first prince to the second, 'What wondrous item did you find?' From under his cloak the second prince unrolled a carpet. 'A 40 flying carpet. People who sit on it can be transported anywhere in the world they wish to go in minutes.' `If they don't mind sitting next to you,' another prince murmured, holding his nose. And now it was the third prince's turn to show what he had brought. 45 `This vial,' said the third prince, 'holds a magical healing ointment. One dab of it will restore the health of anyone, no matter how sick. And they say if it's rubbed with true love, it can even restore youth.' `Speaking of health,' said the second prince to the first, 'since you have a crystal ball, let's take a look at our princess and see how 50 she fares.' The first prince waved his hands over the crystal ball; its cloudiness disappeared and was replaced with an image of the princess lying in her bed, still as death. Her father and the court physicians hovered over her. 'Isn't there anything you can do?' 55 said the king. 'Sire, we have done everything,' said the head court physician. 'I'm sorry, but she has very little time left.' The three princes leapt up, alarmed. 'Alas!' cried the third prince. 'My ointment would heal her, but we're too far from the palace — we'll never get there in time!' 60 

`Quick, everyone on my magic carpet,' said the second prince. `We'll get there in a flash!' Indeed, moments later the three princes were standing in the very room they had viewed through the crystal ball only minutes before. Everyone was so distraught they didn't notice the three princes had suddenly appeared in the room. Without a word, the third prince stepped up to the princess's bed and with his finger touched a dab of ointment on her forehead and set the ointment by her bedstand. She blinked and seconds later opened her eyes. Then she moved her head, and sat up. 'I feel better,' she said. `It's a miracle!' cried the father, and he embraced his daughter. Later that night, the three princes appeared before the king. `Your majesty,' said the first prince, 'each of us may have located a magical item. But there is no doubt that my crystal ball is the most wondrous item of all. Without it, none of us would have known the princess was sick in the first place. I submit that mine is the most wondrous item and therefore I deserve the hand of the princess.' `With all due respect,' said the second prince, stepping forward, 'while it was informative to learn that the princess was sick, had we not been able to travel a week's journey in a blink of an eye on my flying carpet, that knowledge would have done us no good. I submit that mine is the most wondrous item and therefore I deserve the hand of the princess.' `Good sire,' said the third prince. 'While it may have been useful to learn the princess was sick and was helpful to arrive here as quickly as we did, had we not had my magical ointment, all that knowledge and all that quickness would have been in vain. I submit that mine is the most wondrous item and therefore I deserve the hand of the princess.' The king was perplexed. Each of the princes made a good argument. And since the question was so close, no matter which prince he selected, he was sure to raise the ire of the other two and their neighbouring city-states. `I'll think about it,' he said. 'Come back tomorrow' That night, the king summoned his viziers to ask their advice. `Sire,' said his head vizier, 'there is a wise old man who lives amongst us who hails from very far away, a distant country called Russia. He is well known for his sage advice, and if we allow him to make the decision, the communities of the princes who aren't chosen will get angry at a country far away, and not at us.' 

‘Excellent thought,’ said the king. ‘Summon him to court 
tomorrow.’
The next day when the three princes arrived to hear which of
them would be selected, at court stood a very old man. He hobbled 
on his cane and spoke in a whisper. The three princes repeated why
they thought they deserved the hand of the princess. 110
‘As far as I’m concerned,’ asserted the king, ‘each of these fine
young men has an equal claim to my daughter’s hand. And so,’ he
turned to his guest, ‘I am interested. You come from a faraway land.
What is your opinion?’ is
The old man coughed and cleared his throat. ‘Your Majesty, first 115
allow me to say that it is an honour to be in your court.’ He raised if
a shaky hand toward the princes. ‘There’s no doubt that each of you
brought a wondrous item that saved the life of the princess. But in
my country, when it comes to marriage, there are those who say
that the young woman, whose happiness is at stake, should have 120 f
a say in the matter. And so I would ask our royal highness.’ He
turned to her. ‘Princess, whom do you wish to marry?’
