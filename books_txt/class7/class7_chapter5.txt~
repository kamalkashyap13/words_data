Kites were used approximately 2800 years ago in China, where materials ideal for kite building were readily available: silk fabric for the sail material; ﬁne, strong silk for the ﬂying line; and resilient bamboo for the lightweight framework. Ancient and medieval Chinese sources list the use of kites for measuring distances, testing the wind, lifting men, signalling, and communication for military operations. The earliest known Chinese kites were ﬂat (not bowed) and often rectangular. Later, tail—less kites were developed. Kites were decorated with mythological motifs and legendary ﬁgures; some were ﬁtted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while ﬂying.
After its introduction into India, the kite further evolved into the ﬁghter kite known as the patang in India, and annual kite running competitions are held every year on the day of Makar Sankaranti. In Afghanistan, kite running is an ancient tradition, and it is regarded as an art as well as a sport; the aim of the kite runners is to cut the string of the kites belonging to their opponents with the string of their own. It is exciting and fun, but can also be dangerous, as kite runners can fall or run into things while they are involved in mid—air duels with rivals.
The period from 1860 to about 1910 was the golden age of kiting. Kites started to be used for scientiﬁc purposes, especially those to do With weather forecasting and photography; reliable manned kites were developed, as well as power kites. Then the invention of the powered aeroplane diminished the interest in kites, and since then they have been used mainly for recreation. You can see them being ﬂown every evening in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, nearly three thousand years after they were ﬁrst invented, in all shapes and forms, including eagles.
However, children nowadays do not ﬂy kites as much as in previous times. The rival attractions of computer games have reduced the appeal of all outdoor activities, and there are fewer large spaces where kite ﬂying can safely be done, thanks to the increase in the number of tall buildings and overhead power cables in so many countries.

A 9—year—old boy from Albuquerque, New Mexico, is preparing to make history by becoming the youngest trained pilot to fly solo in a hot air balloon. Bobby Bradley has been training for this moment since he was just 4 years old. He has more experience than some professional pilots, and admits that he’s excited  but not nervous about the prospect. He will take off in about 7 weeks’ time.
Bobby’s parents are Troy and Tami Bradley, who are well known in the ballooning community as two of the best in the world. They have won some of the biggest races ever staged, and Troy co-piloted the ﬁrst ever  balloon to journey from North America to Africa, making his ﬁrst solo ﬂight when he was 14.
Judging by interviews, young Bobby Bradley seems totally comfortable piloting the balloon and should have no problems. He says, ‘l’ve always wanted to fly solo, and I’ve had plenty of time to train.’

It was morning, and the new sun sparkled gold across the ripples of a gentle sea. A mile from shore a fishing boat chummed the water, and the word for Breakfast Flock ﬂashed through the air, till a crowd of a thousand seagulls came to dodge and ﬁght for bits of food. It was another busy day beginning But way off alone, out by himself beyond boat and shore, Jonathan Livingston Seagull was practising. A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to hold a painful hard twisting curve through his wings. The curve meant that he would ﬂy slowly, and now he slowed until the wind was a whisper in  his face, until the ocean stood still beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath, forced one ... single  more  inch  of . .. curve  Then his feathers rufﬂed, he stalled and fell. Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall.  To stall in the air is for them disgrace and it is dishonour. But Jonathan Livingston Seagull, unashamed, stretching his wings again in that trembling hard curve — slowing, slowing, and stalling once more — was no ordinary bird. Most gulls don’t bother to learn more than the simplest facts of ﬂight — how to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not ﬂying that matters, but eating. For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but ﬂight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to ﬂy This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one’s self popular with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting.

The young seagull was alone on his ledge his two brothers and his sister had already ﬂown away the day before he had been afraid to ﬂy with them somehow when he had taken a little run forward to the brink of the ledge and attempted to ﬂap his wings, he became afraid the great expanse of sea stretched down beneath, and it was such a long way down, miles down, he felt certain that his wings would never support him, so he bent his head and ran away back to the little hole under the ledge where he slept at night.  Even when each of his brothers and his little sister whose wings were far shorter than his own ran to the brink ﬂapped their Wings and ﬂew away he failed to muster up courage to take that plunge which appeared to him so desperate. His father and mother had come around calling to him shrilly scolding him threatening to let him starve on his ledge unless he ﬂew away but for the life of him he could not move.
That was twenty-four hours ago since then nobody had come near him the day before all daylong he had watched his parents ﬂying about with his brothers and sister perfecting them in the art of ﬂight teaching them how to skim the waves and how to dive for fish he had in fact seen his older brother catch his first herring and devour it standing on a rock while his parents circled around raising a proud cackle and all the morning the whole family had walked about on the big plateau midway down the opposite cliff laughing at his cowardice.

Long ago, before Eagles were chiefs of people, Grandmother Eagle was warming her feathers near Inya, the Sun. Down she gazed with sharp eyes, spying Kwinyaw, the Rabbit, who hopped to and fro.  ‘I am hungry,’ Grandmother Eagle said. She folded her wings and swooped from near Inya, the Sun, and upon Kwinyaw Before she opened her claws to snatch her prey, a baby Kwinyaw, as she had never seen before, scampered from the bushes.  Grandmother Eagle alighted beside Kwinyaw and said, ‘What is that?’  Kwinyaw, seeing that Grandmother Eagle had decided not to eat her, responded, ‘This is my child ’.  ‘Where did he come from? ’  ‘I dug him from the ground ’. (For, in those days, children were not born, but sprang in infancy from the soil and water.)

‘Where may I find a child of my own?” Grandmother Eagle  asked.
‘I do not know, ’ answered Kwinyaw, thumping her hind legs.  ‘Ask lnya, the Sun.’
As Grandmother Eagle warmed her feathers, lnya, the Sun, bade her fly low over the spring of Ah—ha’ Kwe’se—i, and there she would find her child.

Speeding toward the spring of Ah-ha’ Kwe’se-i, she dove low over the enchanted pool, and there was her son floating on its limpid pureness. Smiling as never before, Grandmother Eagle lifted him from Ah-ha’ Kwe’se-i, and carried him to her nest upon the cliffs of the Ah-ha’ Kwe—ah-mac ’, far above the stone fangs which loomed sharply from the mountain base.
She said to her son, ‘I will call you Kwaaypaay, for you will be chief of people’.
Off Grandmother Eagle flew, picking food for her son. At first, she chose small creatures, but he grew and she fed him larger and larger prey.
One day, Grandmother Eagle alighted above him, and asked him to join her in a Visit to lnya, the Sun. Alas, as always, Kwaaypaay refused and squeaked for more food.
Grandmother Eagle began to worry ‘He depends on me for everything. Gladly I provide. But he refuses to venture into the wide world beyond the Ah-ha’ Kwe-ah-mac ’. He will never fly high enough to warm his feathers beside Inya, the Sun.’
Grandmother Eagle decided to show her son the wide world beyond the Ah-ha’ Kwe-ah-mac ’. Pointing toward the southernmost Coyote Mountains, she said, ‘There is where crafty Huta-pah' ate the heart of his father'.


Grandmother Eagle woke him, ‘There, toward the morning home of Inya, the Sun, lies Water in Rock, warm springs welling from desert sands.’
Kwaaypaay lazily stepped to the edge of the nest, feeling the familiar push against his back before he plunged out.
He cried and flapped. The craggy rocks shook their heads. And just as he was sure to be destroyed, Grandmother Eagle grasped him gently and lifted him away.

How many days this went on, only the stones know But one day, as Kwaaypaay plunged toward the stone fangs at the mountain base, he caught a draft within his feathers. lt slowed his fall. He flapped again, harder now, and behold, he halted his fall.
Grandmother Eagle swooped down, calling, ‘Glide over here’.  He spread his wings, cupping the wind beneath his feathers, and glided toward Grandmother Eagle. An updraft caught him and lifted him until he was soaring above the nest.
‘ Come, ’ Grandmother Eagle called from within the nest, ‘ let us eat together ’.
Kwaaypaay shook his head and circled. ‘No. l have spent enough days in the nest. I want to warm my feathers beside Inya, the Sun, and. venture into the wide world beyond the Ah-ha’. Kwe-ah—mac’.’
Grandmother Eagle was proud and happy, for she knew that Kwaaypaay would truly be chief of people.
