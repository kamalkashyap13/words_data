My name is Alﬁe Small, and I’m a famous explorer. I have lots of dangerous adventures and always take my rucksack with me, just in case! At the bottom of my garden, behind the rickety shed, is the special place I go exploring. The grass grows long and the weeds are tall and I never know what I might ﬁnd. Today, I pushed through the weeds and found a small boat ﬂoating on a small stream. I climbed aboard and paddled away.
If you think this is the kind of story where ﬁve children, armed only with a bucket and spade, catch a dangerous band of smugglers, you’d be wrong. And if you think this is the kind of story where a poor helpless little girl is captured by a terrible gang of cut-throat pirates  you’d still be wrong, but a lot closer. Now, those are all the hints I’m going to give you.

So I climbed aboard and paddled away. The stream got bigger and the water ﬂowed faster, and soon I was racing along as fast as a speedboat. I saw a huge boulder blocking the river. It was shaped like a dragon’s head and my boat raced straight towards it. Help! I thought I was going to crash. Then, with an awful grinding noise, the rock began to move. A dark cave opened up like a yawning mouth, and I was swept inside. Whoosh! I whizzed along a gloomy tunnel, holding on tight as my boat zigzagged between rocks as sharp as dragon fangs. The water roared and my boat spun round and round. Soon I couldn’t tell which way was home. Suddenly, I shot out of the tunnel and found myself ﬂoating on a choppy sea. In the distance was a small island, with a plume of smoke billowing up from behind some trees. I steered my boat towards it.

Today, I pushed through the weeds and found a big, stripy balloon with a wicker basket hanging underneath. “Come on, led!” I cried, jumping into the basket. I untied a rope, and the balloon rose high into the sky.Thick, shifting clouds loomed before us. They formed into the shape of a monstrous ogre’s face. Its grinning mouth opened wideand we were swept inside. led began to whine. “Oh, help! Watch out, boy,” I cried, as our balloon was buffeted about, and we were thrown around the basket like clothes in a washing machine. Soon I couldn’t tell which way was home. Suddenly, we went spinning out of the cloud. Below us, everything had changed and now we were ﬂoating above a strange, rocky landscape.

“You see, Lily, the Villagers needed ﬁre to warm their homes, and cook their food, and make life good. So they chose the biggest, bravest man in the Village. They gave him a ﬁne spear and they called him Fire Snatcher. My da, your great-granda, Lily, was Fire Snatcher and hero of the Village.” “But how did he snatch the ﬁre?" asked Lily.
“Well, Lily, dragons are strange creatures,” said Granda. “They lay their eggs, then sleep for a full ninety years until the eggs are ready to hatch. When that happens, the dragon mothers wake up to care for their babies. The dragons were in their sleep-years when my do was Fire Snatcher. All he had to do was creep, tiptoe-quiet into the hills, then jump, suddenvly, lona sleeping dragon and poke it with his spear.
"The poor beast would start from its sleep and with fright, just as you or I would if anybody jabbed at us with a needle while we were sleeping. But it worked. It made the dragon roar ﬁre. As it roared, the Fire Snatcher thrust his torch of dry wood into the flare of the dragon's fiery breath to light it."


One day, when Dragon Boy had been hufﬁng and pufﬁng nothing but whistles, some young dragons began laughing at him. Dragon Boy went off sadly on his own.
As the sun began to set, Dragon Boy turned for home. But he was still so cross that he kicked angrily at the ﬂint stones under his feet. As one struck another, Dragon Boy saw a ﬂash of yellow. “Fire!” shouted Dragon Boy. “I’ve made ﬁre without having tobreathe it!
Quickly he began collecting dry grass and sticks and bigger logs. Then, crouching down with his back to the wind, he struck two sharp ﬂints, one against the other. CLACK! At ﬁrst the stones just smelled a little smoky.
CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! He struck them again and again, until at last a spark ﬂashed and took to the grass. As the grass smouldered and smoked, Dragon Boy blew on it gently. He sang a ﬁery dragon song, and suddenly the smouldering ﬂowered into ﬂames.
