The piano arrived too late to stop the sky falling in. If it had come earlier, things might have ended on a sweet note. As it  was, everything was jangled, unstrung, struck dumb.
The rumour spread from burrow to burrow down the length of the Great River. The females, eyeing each other over their boundaries, commented on it in hushed tones. The males spoke of it with raised chins and deﬁant looks, before moving on and away to their own  business. The rumour told of a new danger to the Folk. It told of a horror which came in the night. It told of the Great River stripped bare of her people, of entire colonies gone. It told of the end of their world.

But perhaps, they thought, a rumour is all it was. The ancient enemies — the fox, heron, weasel — had always been there, awaiting the unwary or unlucky. And still the Folk prospered. The Great River sang, her grasses were plentiful, and her waters were warm and bustling with life. No, perhaps rumours were only rumours and the lives of the Folk would continue as before. But even so the mothers turned an eye to their young, and slept more lightly than they had. And the males scented the breeze more carefully before straying the open, ran more quickly, fed more watchfully.
Sylvan and the others, nestling in their chamber, knew nothing of the rumours. They knew nothing of the outside. They knew their mother, the scents of their home, and the rhythms of the Great River. They knew hunger which could be quenched with milk. But one day they would learn that sometimes a rumour is more than a rumour.  Sometimes a rumour is a life which has yet to come.

The dawn was grey and the waters quiet. Sylvan was the ﬁrst awake, lying with his brother and sisters in a pile of cosily intertwined limbs. Their breathing lulled him even as lightness spread up the tunnel and into the chamber, bringing with it the scent of the morning. He yawned. He opened his eyes. He grinned. Today was the day. At last.
Sylvan extracted himself, ignoring the others' sleepy protest, and sat w1th twitching whiskers at the entrance to the chamber. He should wait for them, he knew. They were supposed to go out all together. But the air stirred with a promise of new things and, with a ﬁnal glance at his siblings, he stole away down the tunnel, paws padding on the soil. He had known the way for ages now. A left, a right, loop around a knot of roots, then pause at the place where the roof had fallen. One eye to the sky. Quiver. Listen. Check the scents. Then onwards and downwards to the lower places, the entrance to the Great River and the gateway to the world.
With each downward step the light grew brighter and the air fesher, more exhilarating. Another turn, a slight rise. And there she was: the Great River. Her waters, lapping against the family’s trampled little platform, were bright through the shade of the tall grasses. She ﬁlled him with her vastness, her movement, her song. He felt the stirrings of hunger, the desire to dive, to twist, to ﬂow river with her. He hesitated, one forefoot raised, everything urging him out and into the world.
“And what exactly do you think you’re doing, young vole?" A paw was on his tail, pinning it to the ﬂoor. Sylvan froze. He placed his foot hurriedly back onto the ground. As his mother removed her paw he turned, radiating guilt.

“Come on, Tiny. Mother’s promised we’re going out today.”  Aven gasped and sat upright, pawing the sleep from her eyes. She groomed a little, setting her fur straight. She blinked her black eyes into focus. “Sylvan,” she said sweetly, “if you ever call me that again I’ll gnaw your ears off.” Sylvan grinned, "You’ll have to catch me ﬁrst.”  “Or wait until you’re asleep.”  He thought about it. "Good point, ” he conceded. “Can we go out now?”  Orris uncurled a little. "What’s so good about going out, anyway?”  Sylvan sat back on his hind feet. “I don’t know. It’s just  better out there." “ Better ?” said Orris. “Only if ’ better ’ means ‘full of weasels and owls and things that want to eat us’. I think I’ll stay here."  “Mother said we’re going out,” said Sylvan, stubbornly.  “I hope you enjoy yourselves.”  “Look,” said Sylvan, “I’m the oldest and you need to do what I say. ”  “Says who?” said Aven.


It was time for our weekend educational outing. Maximilian dragged his heels as he always did on days like these; I can’t think why. I believe a museum is most beneficial and improving. I always dress smartly on our outings, but my good coat is a little warm so I sat down on the bench in the Dinosaur Hall; you can see all the way down the hall from there, so I can keep an eye on Maximilian. That is the difficulty with weekends — so many people.
“Stay where I can see you,” I warned. I wish that attendant had not sat down on my bench. i like my space and the other one was quite empty, if perhaps a little further away.

“Maximilian, this notice gives excellent information about Tyrannosaurus Rex." Is a bone missing just there? No. It must be my imagination. So much for education — Maximilian was nowhere near the replica dinosaur although I soon spied him further down the hall. I should have suspected he would find a food kiosk more interesting than the Jurassic era. Really!

Some people don’t know how to sit — just sit. Like the lady on the other end of the bench. Fiddling about, buttoning her coat tight, fanning herself like crazy — craning her neck to see all over. Sitting’s for relaxing, watching, thinking. I would’ve asked if she was OK but I was beat. Night shifts finish me but I like to be here waiting for young Jax when I come off shift. Wouldn’t let her down. She loves that T—Rex. Knows every bone, she does, and has done since she was a nipper! Smart cookie she is. Reckoned I’d just put up with Miss Fidgety till Jax came with me coffee.

Poor Dad, he was sooooo tired, but we always do the dinos after his night shift — I  think it cheers him up. I was getting him a coffee at the kiosk when this boy joined  the queue, bouncing up and down all around me; he kept looking nervously  over at this lady in a purple woollen coat sitting near Dad on the Dino Bench. She  must have been sweltering — didn’t she look outside this morning? For a moment  I thought something was add about the T—Rex but the boy was getting ON MY  NERVES with all his bobbing about so I was distracted and forgot what I’d seen.
“You up for a cool drink, then?” I said. He cast another quick glance at The Purple Coat: then grinned and nodded. That broke the ice and we got chatting. He  was a laugh, with loads of jokes and silly voices — just the way i imagine a younger  brother would be if I had one. We’d just got to the front of the queue when I spotted  The Purple Coat bustling our way.

Oliver has ﬂown to Africa to ﬁnd his scientist father. The minute he lands in Zimbabwe nothing goes according to plan. Before he knows it he is on a bus to Victoria Falls with a girl called Zinzi and  a bushbaby called Bobo.
