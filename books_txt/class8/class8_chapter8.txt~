The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped with his haunches under him, ready for his leap. He made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself. The result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing almost where he left ground.  ‘Man!’ he snapped. ‘A man‘s cub. Look!’  Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked brown baby who could just walk. He looked up into Father Wolf’s face, and laughed.  ‘Is that a man‘s cub?’ said Mother Wolf. ‘1 have never seen one. Bring it here.’  A Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolf’s jaws closed right on the child’s back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs.  ‘How little! How naked, and — how bold!’ said Mother Wolf softly The baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide. ‘Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man’s cub among her children?’  ‘I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in my time,’ said Father Wolf.‘l-Ie is altogether without hair, and I could kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not afraid.‘  The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere  Khan’s great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance.  ‘Shere Khan does us great honour,’ said Father Wolf, but his eyes were very angry. ‘What does Shere Khan need?’  ‘My quan'y. A man’s cub went this way,‘ said Shere Khan. ‘Its parents have run off. Give it to me.’  But Father Wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by. Even where he was, Shere Khan’s shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of room.  ‘The Wolves are a free people,’ said Father Wolf. ‘They take orders from the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle speaks?'there- killer. The man’s cub is ours — to kill if we choose.’  ‘Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!

The tiger's roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes. like two green moons in the darkness facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.  
‘And it is l, Raksha The Demon, who answers. The man’s cub is mine, Lungri - mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end,  look you, hunter of little naked cubs-frog-eater—fish-killer — he shall hunt thee‘.

Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in the Pack and was not called The Demon for compliments sake. Shere Khan might have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother Wolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground, and would fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth growling, and when he was clear he shouted:
  ‘Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will come in the end. 0 bush-tailed thieves!‘
  Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf said to her gravely:
  ‘Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack. Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?”
  ‘Keep him!’ she gasped. ‘He came naked, by night, alone and very hungry; yet he was not afraid! And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little frog.  thou Mowgli - for Mowgli the Frog  will call thee — the time will come when thou  Wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.’ 
‘But what will our Pack say?” said Father Wolf.

 Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the Council Rock - a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and colour. The Lone Wolf had led them for a year now. He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he had been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs of men. There was very little talking at the Rock. Akela from his rock would cry: ‘Ye know the Law ye know the Law. Look well,  Wolves.

At last Father Wolf pushed ‘Mowgli the Frog’ into the centre,
where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened
in the moonlight.
Akela never raised his head from his paws. A muffled roar came
up from behind the rocks - the voice of Shere Khan crying: ‘The
cub is mine. Give him to me. What have the Free People to do with
a man’s cub?’ Akela never even twitched his ears. All he said was:
“Look well, 0 Wolves!’
There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his
fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have
the Free People to do with a man's cub?” Now, the Law of the Jungle
lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to
be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two
members of the Pack who are not his father and mother.
“Who speaks for this cub?’ said Akela. ‘Among the Free People
who speaks?' There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for
what she knew would be her last fight, if things came to fighting.
Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack
Council - Baloo. the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs
the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he
pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey - rose upon
his hind quarters and grunted.
‘I speak for the mans cub. There is no harm in a man’s cub. l
have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the
Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.’
‘We need yet another] said Akela. ‘Baloo has spoken, and he is
our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?'
A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera
the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther
markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered
silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path;
for he was as cunning as the jackal, as bold as the wild buffalo, and
as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as
wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.
‘0 Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, ‘I have no right
in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a
doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life 7
of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does nOt say
who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?”
‘Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry.
“Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.” 3
‘To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport
for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to
Baloo word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed. not
half a mile from here, if ye will accept the mans cub according to
the Law. Is it difficult?”
There was a clamour of scores of voices, saying: “What matter?
He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What
harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where
is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela's
deep bay, crying: ‘Look well - look well, 0 Wolves!”
Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did
not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At
last they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela.
Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli”s own wolves were left. Shere Khan
roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not
been handed over to him.
‘Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, ‘for the time
will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to anOther
tune, or I know nothing of man.’
‘It was well done,” said Akela. ‘Men and their cubs are very m'se.
He may be a help in time.”
“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack
forever,” said Bagheera.
Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to
every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he
gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a
new leader comes up - to be killed in his turn.
‘Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits
one of the Free People.”
And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack
for the price of a bull and on Baloo”s good word.


I put my day’s supply of food into my day food bag and then began
to pack the tent. 1 was completely engrossed in pulling the freezing
tent poles out of the ice, when suddenly I heard a deep, long growl
coming from the depths of Charlie’s throat. I looked at him and
then in the direction in which he was staring. Even before I looked
I knew what I would see. A polar bear!
It was a female followed by two cubs coming slowly,
purposefully, plodding through the rough shore ice towards me.
They were 200 metres away. With a pounding heart I grabbed
my loaded rifle and flare gun and carefully walked sideways
a few steps to Charlie, who was snarling with a savagery
that caught my breath. Without taking my eyes off the bear,
I unclipped Charlie from his ice anchor and, again walking
sideways, I led him to the sled where I clipped his chain to
a tie-down rope.

The bear, now only 150 metres
away, wasn’t stopping. Her cubs had 
dropped back but she came on with
a steady measured stride, while I
frantically tried to remember all
the advice I had been given. Keep
eye contact, move sideways or I
slightly forward, never backward,
stay calm, don’t show fear, stand 
beside a tent, sled, or other large 
object to make my short body 
appear as large as possible. Don't , I
shoot unless forced to. Don’t
wound a bear - you’ll make it 
even more dangerous - and 
never run. Repeating to 
myself, ‘Stay calm, stay 
calm,’ I fired a warning 
shot to the bear’s left. 
The loud explosion had no effect. On she came. I fired a flare, landing it a little to her
right. Her head moved slightly in its direction but she didn’t stop.
I fired another flare, this time dropping it right in front of her. She
stopped, looked at the flare burning a bright red on the white ice,
then looked at me. She was only 30 metres away now.
By this time my nerves were as tight as violin strings and my
heart could have been heard at base camp. The bear began to step
around the flare, and I dropped another a metre in front of her.
Again she stopped, looked at the flare and at me. Then she fixed
her tiny black eyes on Charlie, who was straining at the end of
his chain, snapping and snarling, trying to reach her. She looked
back at her cubs. I could sense her concern about Charlie’s snarling
and her cubs. She waited for her cubs to catch up, then moved to
my left in a half circle. I fired two more flares in quick succession,
trying to draw a line between her and me. She stopped, then
moved back towards my right. I fired two more flares and again
she stopped. She seemed to want to cross the line of flares but was
unsure of the result and of Charlie, so she elected to stay back. She
kept moving right in a half circle, still 30 metres away. Finally, with
a last long look she plodded north with her two new cubs trotting
behind her, their snow-white coats contrasting with their mother’s
creamy, pale yellow colour.
The whole episode lasted 15 minutes but seemed years long.
My hands were shaking as I stood, still holding my rifle and flare
gun, watching the trio slowly move north. But in spite of the
mind-numbing fear that still gripped me, I could feel deep down
inside a real satisfaction. I now knew that I could stand up to a
bear in the wild and stay calm enough to function. With Charlie‘s
help I had passed my first test.

After the Week of Peace every man and his family began to clear the
bush to make new farms. The cut bush was left to dry and fire was
then set to it. As the smoke rose into the sky kites appeared from
different directions and hovered over the burning field in silent
valediction. The rainy season was approaching when they would go
away until the dry season returned.
Okonkwo spent the next few days preparing his seed-yams. He
looked at each yam carefully to see whether it was good for sowing.
Sometimes he decided that a yam was too big to be sown as one
seed and he split it deftly along its length with his sharp knife.
His eldest son, Nwoye, and Ikemefuna helped him by fetching the
yams in long baskets from the barn and in counting the prepared
seeds in groups of four hundred.
Sometimes Okonkwo gave them a few yams each to prepare.
But he always found fault with their effort, and he said so with
much threatening. lnwardly Okonkwo knew that the boys were
still too young to understand fully the
difficult art of preparing seed-yams.
But he thought that one could 
not begin too early. 

rains, Okonkwo and his family went to the farm with baskets of
seed-yams, their hoes and machetes, and the planting began. They
made single mounds of earth in straight lines all over the field and
sowed the yams in them.

Yam, the king of crops, was a very exacting king. For three or
four moons it demanded hard work and constant attention from
cockcrow till the chickens went back to roost. The young tendrils
were protected from earth-heat with rings of sisal leaves. As the
rains became heaw’er the women planted maize. melons and beans
between the yarn mounds. The yams were then staked, first with
little sticks and later with tall and big tree branches. The women
weeded the farm three times at definite periods in the life of the
yams, neither early nor late.

And now the rains had really come, so heavy and persistent that
even the village rain-maker no longer claimed to be able to intervene.
He could not stop the rain now, just as he would not attempt to start
it in the heart of the dry season, without serious danger to his own
health. The personal dynamism required to counter the forces of these
extremes of weather would be far too great for the human frame.

And so nature was not interfered with in the middle of the rainy
season. Sometimes it poured down in such thick sheets of water
that earth and sky seemed merged in one grey wetness. It was then
uncertain whether the low rumbling of Amadiora’s thunder came
from above or below. At such times, in each of the countless thatch
huts of Umuofia, children sat around their mother’s cooking fire
telling stories, or with their father in his obi warming themselves
from a log fire, roasting and eating maize. It was a brief resting
period between the exacting and ardous planting season and the
equally exacting but light-hearted month of harvests.


The key turned stiffly in the lock, but it turned. The door opened,
and Nicholas was in an unknown land.
Often and often Nicholas had pictured to himself what
the lumber-room might be like, that region that was so
carefully sealed from youthful eyes and concerning
which no questions were ever answered. It came up
to his expectations. In the first place it was large
and dimly lit, one high window opening on to
the forbidden garden being its only source
of illumination. In the second place it was 
a storehouse of unimagined treasures. Such
parts of the house as Nicholas knew best were
rather bare and cheerless, but here there were
wonderful things for the eye to least on. First 
and foremost there was a piece of framed
tapestry that was evidently meant to be a fire
screen. To Nicholas it was a living, breathing
story; he sat down on a roll of lndian
hangings, glowing in wonderful colours
beneath a layer of dust, and took in all the
details of the tapestry picture.
There were other objects of delight 
and interest claiming his instant 
attention: here were quaint twisted
candlesticks in the shape of snakes,
and a teapot fashioned like a
china duck, out of whose open 
beak the tea was supposed to 
come. How dull and shapeless
the nursery teapot seemed in
comparison! And there was 
a carved sandal-wood box
packed tight with aromatic
cotton-wool, and between
the layers of cotton-wool
were little brass figures,
hump-necked bulls, and peacocks
and goblins, delightful to see and to handle.
Less promising in appearance was a large square book with plain black covers; Nicholas peeped into it, and,
behold, it was full of coloured pictures of birds. And such birds!
In the garden, and in the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas
came across a few birds, of which the largest were an occasional
magpie or wood-pigeon; here were herons and bustards, kites,
toucans, tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises, golden pheasants, a
whole portrait gallery of undreamed-of creatures. And as he was
admiring the colouring of the mandarin duck and assigning a life-
history to it, the voice of his aunt in shrill vociferation of his name
came from the gooseberry garden without.
