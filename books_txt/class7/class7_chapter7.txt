There was a rattlesnake sunning itself on my back porch yesterday morning, a western diamondback about a metre long. I walked out there barefoot  and half asleep, clutching coffee and newspapers, and almost stepped on its head. My right foot was beginning its blind descent when I heard the rattle, and, before my conscious brain had time  to react, my body leaped back into the house and slammed the door. The snake, of course, was as startled as I was and beat a slithering retreat.  For the past two months I have lived on five acres of unfenced desert outside Tucson, Arizona. There are dozens of isolated houses dotted around but the land in between has been left largely intact since primeval times. Through my study window I have seen dozens  I of varieties of lizards; I have shaken a scorpion out of my shoe and chased a  tarantula out of the kitchen.

But it’s the rattlesnakes that dominate  my perception of this landscape. Their  venom, although seldom fatal to a  healthy adult within reach of hospital,  causes excruciating pain, sickness and  permanent tissue damage. They won’t  l bite unless severely provoked - or  trodden on but the threat never leaves  one’s mind. I am often asked why on  earth I live in such a place, but I enjoy the  presence of rattlesnakes and the wildness  it implies.
At present, the rattlesnakes are preparing for hibernation and  increasingly I am ﬁnding them in the house, attracted by the heat and the rodents that come here to gnaw, nest,  burrow and steal my food. That is a little too close for comfort, but what to do?

In the absence of an ideal solution I  now keep one or two rattlesnakes around l and relocate the others. I fashioned a noose at the end of a long pole and snared a snake around its middle. It struck at the pole and I saw a blur of pink from its mouth and felt the sharp knock of its fangs against the wood. I lowered it into an ice chest and slammed the lid shut with the pole.
My plan was to release the snake in a beautiful canyon in the mountains where I camped last summer. I got there and found it had been bulldozed of its vegetation, closed to the public and littered with hideous condominiums and giant concrete carports. I let the snake go at the entrance gate.

The shyest and most self—effacing of the wall community were the most dangerous; you hardly ever saw one unless you looked for it, and yet there must have been several hundred living in the cracks of the wall. Slide a knife-blade carefully under a piece of loose plaster and lever it gently away from the brick, and there, crouching beneath it, would be a little black scorpion an inch long, looking as though he were made out of polished chocolate. They were weird-looking things, with their ﬂattened, oval bodies, their neat, crooked legs, and enormous crab-like claws, bulbous and as neatly jointed g armour, and the tail ﬁe a string of brown beads ending in a sting @ a rose - thorn. The scorpion would lie there quietly as you examined him, only raising his tail in an almost apologetic gesture of warning if you breathed too hard on him. If you kept him in the sun too long he would simply turn his back on you and walk away, and then slide slowly but firmly under another section of plaster.  I grew very fond of these scorpions. I found them to be pleasant, unassuming creatures with, on the whole, the most charming habits. Provided you did nothing silly or clumsy w putting your hand on one) the scorpions treated you with respect, their one desire being to get away and hide as quickly g possible. They must have found me rather a trial, for I was always ripping sections of the plaster away so that I could watch them, or capturing them and making them walk about in jam jars so that 1 could see the way their feet moved. By means of my sudden and unexpected assaults on the wall I discovered quite a bit about the scorpions.

At first the going was easy. Close to the stream, rocks of granite and quartz provided safe footing; and the trees, sprouting from every pocket of clay, were thick enough to give a welcome shade, but not so thick that they hindered progress. Mary pushed steadily on.  Soon the gully became wider, ﬂatter, fanning into an open plain. Another tiny river joined theirs, and together the two of them went looping away down a shallow, sand-fringed valley. In the middle of the valley the undergrowth was thick; luxuriant. Brambles and underscrub slowed down their progress. But Mary didn’t want to lose sight of the stream. Determinedly she forced a way through the tangle of vegetation, turning every now and then to give her brother a hand. Ground-Vines coiled and snaked and clutched at their feet; the decaying trunks of fallen trees perverser blocked their path; but the girl kept on, sorting out a line of least resistance, holding back the lower branches to protect Peter from their swing back.  To start with -— at least for the boy — it was an amusing game; part of their Big Adventure. They looked in the stream for fish; but the fish, such as they were, were asleep: invisible in the sediment-mud. They looked in the trees for birds; but the birds had vanished with the dawn. They looked in the bush for animals; but the animals were all asleep, avoiding the heat of the sun in carefully chosen burrow, log or cave. They looked among the riverside rocks for lizards; but the reptiles heard their clumsy approach, and slid soundlessly into crack or crevice. The bush slept: motionless: silent: apparently deserted. Drugged to immobility by the heat of the midday sun.

Baby tortoise

You know What it is to be born alone,

Baby tortoise!

The first day to heave your feet little by little from the shell,

Not yet awake,

And remain lapsed on earth,

Not quite alive.
A tiny, fragile, half-animate bean.

To open your tiny beak-mouth, that looks as if it would never open,
Like some iron door;

To lift the upper hawk-beak from the lower base
And reach your skinny little neck
And take your first bite at some dim bit of herbage,
Alone, small insect,
