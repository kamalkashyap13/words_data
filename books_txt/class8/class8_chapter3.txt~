The time when the rains didn‘t come for three months and  the sun was a yellow furnace in the sky was known as the Great Drought in Trinidad. It happened when everyone was expecting the sky to burst open with rain to fill the dry streams and water the parched earth.  But each day was the same; the sun rose early in a blue sky, and all day long the farmers lifted their eyes, wondering what had happened to Parjanya, the rain god. They rested on their hoes and forks and wrung perspiration from their clothes, seeing no hope in labour, terrified by the thought that if no rain fell soon they would lose their crops and livestock and face starvation and death.

In the tiny village of Las Lomas, somewhere in the field, a cow mooed‘m umfully, cracked earth The ﬁeld was a desolation of drought. The trees E: were naked and barks peeled off trunks as if they were diseased. When the Wind blew, it was heavy and unrelieving, as if the heat 1‘: had taken all the spirit out of it. s E Bush fires had swept Las Lomas and left the garden plots ;, charred and smoking. Cattle were dropping dead in the heat. ’ There was scarcely any water in the village; the river was dry E with scummy mud. But suddenly silence and darkness fell together. A large black  ? blob of cloud blotted out the moon. The sky was thick with F clouds piling up on each other and there was a new coolness in the wind. The sky grew black; it looked as if the moon had never been there. The wind became stronger; there was a swift fall of some heavy drops. Then the wind died like a sigh. A low tumble in the east — then silence. Perhaps Paijanya was having a joke with them; perhaps there would be no rain after all.  And then it came sweeping in from the north-east, with a rising wind. Not very heavy at ﬁrst, but in thrusts, coming and going. The villagers opened their mouths and laughed, and water fell in. They shouted and cried and laughed again. Their cheeks were streaming, perhaps with tears, perhaps with Patjanya’s rain.


The sea is a hungry dog
Giant and grey
He rolls on the beach all day
With his clashing teeth and shaggy jaws to 
Hour upon hour he gnaws
The rumbling, tumbling stones
And ‘Bones, bones, bones, bones
The giant sea-dog moans,
Licking his greasy paws.
And when the night wind roars if
And the moon rocks in the stormy cloud
He bounds to his feet and snuffs and sniffs
Shaking his wet sides over the cliffs
And howls and hollos long and loud
But on quiet days in May or June
When even the grasses on the dune
Play no more their reedy tune,
With his head between his paws
He lies on the sandy shores,
So quiet, so quiet, he scarcely snores.

On the road to the bay was a lake of rushes
Where we bathed at times and changed in the bamboos.
Now it is rather to stand and say:
How many roads we take that lead to Nowhere,
The alley overgrown, no meaning now but loss:
Not that veritable garden where everything comes easy.
And by the bay itself were cliffs with carved names
And a hut on the shore beside the Maori ovens.
We raced boats from the banks of the pumice creek
Or swam in those autumnal shallows
Growing cold in amber water, riding the logs
Upstream, and waiting for the taniwha.
So now I remember the bay and the little spiders
On driftwood, so poisonous and quick.
The carved cliffs and the great outcrying surf
With currents round the rocks and the birds rising.
A thousand times an hour is torn across
And burned for the sake of going on living.
But I remember the bay that never was
And stand like stone and cannot turn away.

Known as the Friendly Floatees, the Duck Armada, or the Moby Ducks, tiny yellow
l plastic bath ducks are still circumnavigating the globe 20 years after falling into the ocean
in January 1992. Loaded as a shipment from China to North America, the container was
l swept overboard in the hurricane winds of the Pacific, and 30,000 bath toys set off on a
journey on more turbulent waters than the bathtub they were intended for The container
actually included blue turtles, red beavers and green frogs, but it is the yellow ducks that
have captured the imagination.

Thousands of the toys are still adrift, moving in flotillas, trapped in currents that
stretch from Japan to California. They have been found in the area in which the Titanic
sank. Scientists have been tracking the toys’ movements to learn more about ocean
currents, which affect the climate of the planet. Faded floatees have washed up all over
the world, from Alaska to Australia, or been found trapped in ice; some are thought to
l have travelled up to 8000 kilometres. Originally the company which manufactured them
i offered a $100 reward for finding one; now they have become a collectors’ item and can
be bought on eBay for $2000.
i Considered to be a cute story, it also has a serious side to it. Plastic which is
ground up by the ocean then enters the food chain, consumed by birds and fish.
There is an ever-growing level of plastic compared with plankton in the ocean. It
is a poison and will appear on our dinner plates. There are estimates that there are
10,000 container spills a year, and many of these cargoes - e.g. computers, trainers,
gloves - consist of toxic substances. And only 3% of the toys have been found so far.


Leatherback turtles, which spend nearly all their lives at sea, are famous for making epic
voyages across oceans. It has recently been discovered how good they are at navigation.
The gigantic females - which can grow to two metres long - can swim for thousands
of kilometres in a straight line. They journey from Central Africa to South America,
following the shortest possible route across the Atlantic. It is not known exactly how
they achieve this fear, but they may use the position of the sun and stars to guide them.
Researchers attached satellite tracking devices to the shells of 25 females journeying from
Gabon to Uruguay. It took them 150 days to complete the crossing. There are two Other
migration routes which they use.

In 2006 walking sharks were discovered in Indonesia. They are nocturnal sharks which , ”R
have fins different from any other species which allow them to walk across the sea bed. Their usual diet is shellfish. Indonesia ,‘ contains some of the clearest water and richer reefs for biodiversity on the planet.
The adults are about one metre long. 
bodies are sinuous, like lizards, and their 
faces can be seen as comical. The males and females mix together, unlike other sharks.
When they are disturbed, they simply walk away, without attempting to swim.

I always wake when the sun rises. I get onto my
stilt only on the days when the fish are running
and when the waves are not too high. Between
December and April are the best months, before 
the monsoon comes. The fish don’t see the silver 
hook in the white water. Sardines are the easiest fish, but they earn less
I always go to the same spot, which has always
been the place used for many generations by my
family. Stilts used to be made of wood but the sea
causes damage and now we use metal. I push the
six-metre-long stilt into the reef until it is deep 
enough to take my weight, which means about
third of it is underwater. There is a cross-step to
support me while I fish, but nothing to hold me 
on. I use a rod and line - and a net for bringing 
in the bigger fish - and then I keep them in a bag 
attached to my body until I have finished. 
Ispend a couple of hours fishing in the 
morning, and a few hours more in the evening if 
it is worth returning. It’s very relaxing, thinking
of nothing except fish. I get paid about five
rupees per fish, depending on the size, and sell
them in the main town. The big fishing boats
have large nets which catch many fish, and so I started fishing when I was a child. My
we stilt fishermen end up with fewer fish and children are not interested in continuing the
