Young people these days are exposed to an almost constant stream of the written  word. They communicate by text messages (which now outnumber phone calls), or in internet chatrooms, or by Facebook updates (600,000 comments written every minute), or by tweets (340 million written per day).
When I was a lad, in the 19805, we communicated by landline phone and we watched television. I never wrote a single word to anybody my own age, except perhaps to pass notes in class when I was bored. The internet and the mobile phone have changed all that, and put an unprecedented new emphasis on the written word, despite all the predictions that new technology would be the death of it.
Written words are important now. Everything, especially for the young, depends on them. Online chatting and searching, proﬁles and home pages, messaging and emailing, all depend on writing, and writing quickly. There is no time now for pondering the right phrase or planning the best way to say something before you make that phone call; that text and that mail demand an instant response. Communications have become shorter and more concise, more like epigrams than old-fashioned letters put in the post. Whether communications have actually become clearer and less ambiguous, or more subject to misunderstanding, is another matter.

The essential difference between writing and speaking is that writing can be crossed out, whereas speech cannot. Communication is now a continuous work in progress, as long as it’s done on screen, and as long as you delete it before anyone reads it. Which is just as well, because instead of technology having made accuracy of spelling and grammar irrelevant, the move from the spoken to the written word has had the opposite effect: we judge accuracy severely, whether it be a romantic message or a job application, and are unimpressed by people who don’t know how to use apostrophes or that deﬁnitely is spelt with an i
Glancing around the internet, you can ﬁnd examples of terrible English, but you’ll also ﬁnd an astonishing number of corrections.
There has probably never been a time in history when writing was so universal and so  important. Books on the English language, even books on punctuation, can now top the bestseller lists. The decay of language and the disappearance of poetry and printed books — because of texting and tweeting — the self—love of Facebook, the rise of e—books, were prophesied until very recently, but no more. Words are surging around and across the world in an extraordinary, unstoppable blizzard, written and read on a scale that is quite mind boggling. Today, the Philippines holds the  record for texting: 27 per user per day. In Scandinavia, more than 85 per cent of the population communicates by text. Some 294 billion e-mail messages are sent every day, or 2.8 million per second. These are communications that until recently were made by telephone, letter, face to face — or, and this is highly signiﬁcant in the communication debate, not at all.

Languages are dying out 
The world's native languages are dying out at an unprecedented rate, taking with them irreplaceable knowledge about the natural world, according to a National Geographic study. The five places where languages are disappearing the fastest are eastern Siberia, northern Australia, central South America, the US state of Oklahoma and the US Pacific Northwest. `Languages are undergoing a global  extinction crisis that greatly exceeds the pace of species extinction,' linguistics professor David Harrison said. He expects half of the world's 7,000 languages to disappear before the end of the twenty-first century. He said that indigenous people had an intimate knowledge of their environment that was lost when their language disappeared, along with their ideas about the nature of time and mathematics. 'Most of what we know about ecosystems is not written down anywhere, If only in people's heads,' he said. 
The National Geographic research team travelled to Australia to study Aboriginal languages, some of the most endangered. `Australia is amazing because humans have been there for 50,000 years and they represent an unbroken link to the past in a way that other places on Earth don't,' Harrison said. `You can really glimpse human prehistory and the mythological beliefs and systems that they have produced and passed on orally with absolutely no recourse to writing of any kind.' The researchers said that all five of the areas identified had been successfully colonised and a dominant language — Spanish or English was threatening native tongues. Harrison said that in Australia the team were heartened to see a woman in her eighties, who was one of only three remaining speakers of the Yawuru language, passing on her knowledge to schoolchildren. He said that such inter-generational exchanges  were the only way native languages could survive. Bangkok Post

q1164 Whale talk 
The diver was repairing an ocean pen for NoC, a beluga whale, when a call came to get 'Out, out'. He had heard the call before from his colleagues on the surface, so he stopped work and slowly made his way upwards, watched all the time by NoC (pronounced no-see). `Why did you tell me to get out?' he asked the waiting biologists. [1]  , he was met with quizzical looks. None of them had given this instruction. [2]  , it was not the first time that a whale had sounded human: at the Vancouver aquarium in Canada, keepers had suggested that a one-year-old beluga whale had uttered his name, Lagosi. Two biologists, William Schevill and Barbara Lawrence, the first to study beluga whale sounds in the wild in the 1950s, wrote that `occasionally the calls would suggest a crowd of children shouting in the distance'. [3]  , there was the case of a killer whale that had learnt to imitate a motorboat. [4]  , no one had studied whether these warblings were attempts to communicate with humans or just standard calls of whales that 
recordings, which deviate wildly from the usual calls of beluga whales, clearly show that NoC was emulating human speech. The whale, which died five years ago after living at the foundation among dolphins and other whales for 30 years, had developed a human voice and was trying to talk. All belugas, famed for the way in which their faces are able to convey human-like expressions, are extremely social. [6]  , belugas are among the most vocal of the whale family. They can emit an array of sounds, including cackles, moos, whistles, trills and squawks. What is remarkable is the extraordinary effort NoC made. To reach a human sound frequency NoC was having to inflate the sac in his blowhole and vary the pressure in his nasal tract at the same time as making other muscular adjustments. No mean feat. [7]  , the guess was that NoC, who was always so playful, coming up to have his tongue rubbed and roll over onto his back, had 
realised that when the guy at the top shouts, `Out, out', the diver in his pen responds. [8]  , NoC tried to imitate that noise in the hope that he'd be able to communicate by doing so. It has been shown that whales can refer to objects in their vicinity, but the next level of research is to see whether they can talk about objects that are not present, such as invisible predators or food that is far away. They are among the loudest animals on earth; the sounds they make on one side of the Atlantic can be heard by whales on the other side. [9]  , scientists are still a long way from establishing exactly how they communicate. It is unlikely that meaningful conversations could take place between humans and whales; [10]  , NoC's attempts to talk can certainly be taken as an indication of just how intelligent these mammals are. 


How can the purple yeti be so red, Or chestnuts, like a widgeon, calmly groan? No sheep is quite as crooked as a bed, Though chickens ever try to hide a bone. I grieve that greasy turnips slowly march: Indeed, inflated is the icy fig: For as the alligator strikes the larch, So sighs the grazing goldfish for a wig. Oh, has the pilchard argued with a top? Say never that the parsnip is too weird! I tell thee that a wolf-man will not hop And no man ever praised the convex beard. Effulgent is the day when bishops turn: So let not then the doctor wake the urn!
