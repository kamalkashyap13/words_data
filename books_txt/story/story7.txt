It was still too hot to play outdoors. They had had their tea, they had been washed and had their hair brushed, and after the long day of conﬁnement in the house that was not cool but at least a protection from the sun, the children strained to get out. Their faces were red and bloated with the effort, but their mother would not open the door, everything was still curtained and shuttered in a way that stiﬂed the children, made them feel that their lungs were stuffed with cotton wool and their noses with dust and if they didn’t burst out into the light and see the sun and feel the air, they would choke.  ‘Please, ma, please,’ they begged. ‘We’ll play in the veranda and porch — we won’t go a step out of the porch.’  ‘You will, I know you will, and then—’  ‘No — we won’t, we won’t,’ they wailed so horrendously that she actually let down the bolt of the front door so that they burst out like seeds from a crackling, over-ripe pod into‘the veranda, with such wild, maniacal yells that she retreated to her bath and the shower of talcum powder and the fresh sari that were to help her face the summer evemng.  They faced the afternoon. It was too hot. Too bright. The white walls of the veranda glared stridently in the sun. The bougainvillea hung about it, purple and magenta, in livid balloons. The garden outside was like a tray made of beaten brass, ﬂattened out on the red gravel and the stony soil in all shades of metal — aluminium, tin, copper and brass. No life stirred at this arid time of day — the birds still drooped, like dead fruit, in the papery tents of the trees; some squirrels lay limp on the wet earth under the garden tap. The outdoor dog lay stretched as if dead on the veranda mat, his paws and ears and tail all reaching out like dying travellers in search of water. He rolled his eyes at the children — two white marbles rolling in the purple sockets, begging for sympathy ‘ and attempted to lift his tail in a wag but could not. It only twitched and lay still. Then, perhaps roused by the shrieks of the children, a band of parrots suddenly fell out of the eucalyptus tree, tumbled frantically in the still, sizzling air, then sorted themselves out into battle formation and streaked away across the white sky. Games at Twilight 305  children’s day which is — play. ‘Let’s play hide-and—seek.’ ‘Who’ll be It?’ ‘You be It.’ ‘Why should I? You be—’ ‘You’re the eldest—’ ‘That doesn’t mean~’  ‘Make a circle, make a circle!’ she shouted, ﬁrmly pulling and pushing till a kind of vague circle was formed. ‘Now clap! ’ she roared and, clapping, they all chanted in melancholy unison: ‘Dip, dip, dip — my blue ship" and every now and then one or the other saw he was safe by the way his hands fell at the crucial moment — palm on palm, or back of hand on palm — and dropped out of the circle with a yell and a jump of relief and jubilation.  Raghu was It. He started to protest, to cry ‘You cheated — Mira cheated — Anu  a      Skitten\'ng of his red sandals, and charged after him w1th such a blood-curdling yell that Manu stumbled over the hosepipe, fell into its rubber coils and lay there weeping, ‘I Won’t be It — you have to find them all — all — All!’  ‘I know I have to, idiot,’ Raghu said, superciliously kicking him with his toe. ‘You’re dead,’ he said with satisfaction, licking the beads of perspiration off his upper lip, and  then stalked off in search of worthier prey, whistling spiritedly so that the hiders should hear and tremble. 306 Stories of Ourselves  around the garage if he heard Raghu come — around and around and around — but he hadn’t much faith in his short legs when matched against Raghu’s long, hefty, hairy footballer legs. Ravi had a frightening glimpse of them as Raghu combed the hedge of \\ crotons and hibiscus, trampling delicate ferns underfoot as he did so. Ravi looked about L, him desperately, swallowing a small ball of snot in his fear.  1‘ The garage was locked with a great heavy lock to which the driver had the key in ‘1 his room, hanging from a nail on the wall under his work-shirt. Ravi had peeped in and .l seen him still sprawling on his string—cot in his vest and striped underpants, the hair on ‘ his chest and the hair in his nose shaking with the Vibrations of his phlegm-obstructed 1 snores. Ravi had wished he were tall enough, big enough to reach the key on the nail, “ but it was impossible, beyond his reach for years to come. He had sidled away and sat .15; dejectedly on the ﬂower pot. That at least was cut to his own size.  But next to the garage was another shed with a big green door. Also locked. No one  even knew who had the key to the lock. That shed wasn’t opened more than once a year when Ma turned out all the old broken bits of furniture and rolls of matting and leaking buckets, and the white ant hills were broken and swept away and Flit sprayed ‘ into the spider webs and rat holes so that the whole operation was like the looting of a poor, ruined and conquered city. The green leaves of the door sagged. They were “‘1 nearly off their rusty hinges. The hinges were large and made a small gap between the door and the walls — only just large enough for rats, dogs and, possibly, Ravi to slip through. “I Ravi had never cared to enter such a dark and depressing mortuary of defunct i. household goods seething with such unspeakable and alarming animal life but, as Raghu’s whistling grew angrier and sharper and his crashing and storming in the hedge wilder, Ravi suddenly slipped off the ﬂower pot and through the crack and was gone. He t, :1 chuckled aloud with astonishment at his own temerity so that Raghu came out of the ‘l hedge, stood silent with his hands on his hips, listening, and ﬁnally shouted ‘I heard you!  I’m coming! Got you—’ and came charging, round the garage only to ﬁnd the upturned , ﬂower pot, the yellow dust, the crawling of white ants in a mud—hill against the closed ‘i shed door — nothing. Snarling, he bent to pick up a stick and went off, whacking it against the garage and shed walls as if to beat out his prey.  l Ravi shook, then shivered with delight, with self-congratulation. Also with fear. It was \' dark, spooky in the shed. It had a mufﬂed smell, as of graves. Ravi had once got locked into the linen cupboard and sat there weeping for half an hour before he was rescued. But at least that had been a familiar place, and even smelt pleasantly of starch, laundry and, reassuringly, of his mother. But the shed smelt of rats, ant hills, dust and i spider webs. Also of less definable, less recognisable horrors. And it was dark. Except  for the white-hot cracks along the door, there was no light. The roof was very low- i‘ Although Ravi was small, he felt as if he could reach up and touch it with his fingﬁl\' 1 tips. But he didn’t stretch. He hunched himself into a ball so as not to bump into I                 anything, touch or feel anything. What might there not be to touch him and feel him as he stood there trying to see in the dark? Something cold, or slimy — like a snake- Snakes! He leapt up as Raghu whacked the wall with his stick — then, quickly realising Games at Twilight 307  what it was, felt almost relieved to hear Raghu, hear his stick. It made him feel protected.  But Raghu soon moved away. There wasn’t a sound once his footsteps had gone around the garage and disappeared. Ravi stood frozen inside the shed. Then he Shivered all over. Something had tickled the back of his neck. It took him a While to pick up the courage to lift his hand and explore. It was an insect — perhaps a spider — exploring him. He squashed it and wondered how many more creatures were watching him, waiting to reach out and touch him, the stranger.  There was nothing now. After standing in that position — his hand still on his neck, feeling the wet splodge of the squashed spider gradually dry — for minutes, hours, his  patches of enamel glimmered at him and at last he lowered himself onto its edge.  He contemplated slipping out of the shed and into the fray. He wondered if it would not be better to be captured by Raghu and be returned to the milling crowd as long as he could be in the sun, the light, the free spaces of the garden and the familiarity of his brothers, sisters and cousins. It would be evening soon. Their games would become legitimate. The parents would sit out on the lawn on cane basket chairs and watch them as they tore around the garden or gathered in knots to share a loot of mulberries or black, teeth—splitting jamun from the garden trees. The gardener would fix the hosepipe to the water tap and water would fall lavishly through the air to the ground, soaking the dry yellow grass and the red gravel and arousing the sweet, the intoxicating scent of water on dry earth — that loveliest scent in the world. Ravi sniffed for a whiff of it. He half-rose from the bathtub, then heard the despairing scream of one of the girls as Raghu bore down upon her. There was the sound of a crash, and of rolling about in the bushes, the shrubs, then screams and accusing sobs of, ‘I touched the den—’ ‘You did not—’ ‘I \'did—’ ‘You liar, you did not’ and then a fading away and silence again.  Ravi sat back on the harsh edge of the tub, deciding to hold out a bit longer. What fun if they were all found and caught — he alone left unconquered! He had never known that sensation. Nothing more wonderful had ever happened to him than being taken out by an uncle and bought a whole slab of chocolate all to himself, or being ﬂung into the soda—man’s pony cart and driven up to the gate by the friendly driver With the red beard and pointed ears. To defeat Raghu ~ that hirsute, hoarse—voiced football champion — and to be the winner in a circle of older, bigger, luckier children — that would be thrilling beyond imagination. He hugged his knees together and smiled to himself almost shyly at the thought of so much victory, such laurels.  There he sat smiling, knocking his heels against the bathtub, now and then getting up and going to the door to put his ear to the broad crack and listening for sounds of the game, the pursuer and the pursued, and then returning to his seat with the dogged determination of the true winner, a breaker of records, a champion.  It grew darker in the shed as the light at the door grew softer, fuzzier, turned to a kind of crumbling yellow pollen that turned to yellow fur, blue fur, grey fur. Evening. 308 Stories of Ourselves                                 Twilight. The sound of water gushing, falling. The scent of earth receiving water, Slakjng its thirst in great gulps and releasing that green scent of freshness, coolness. Through the crack Ravi saw the long purple shadows of the shed and the garage lying still across the yard. Beyond that, the white walls of the house. The bougainvillea had lost its lividity, hung in dark bundles that quaked and twittered and seethed with masses of homing  It then occurred to him that he could have slipped out long ago, dashed across the yard to the veranda and touched the ‘den’. It was necessary to do that to win. He had forgotten. He had only remembered the part of hiding and trying to elude the seeker. He had done that so successfully, his success had occupied him so wholly that he had quite forgotten that success had to be clinched by that final dash to victory and the ringing cry of ‘Den!’  With a whimper he burst through the crack, fell on his knees, got up and stumbled on stiff, benumbed legs across the shadowy yard, crying heartin by the time he reached the veranda so that when he ﬂung himself at the white pillar and bawled, ‘Den! Den! Denl’ his voice broke with rage and pity at the disgrace of it all and he felt himself ﬂooded with tears and misery. \'  from her basket chair and came towards him, worried, annOyed, saying, ‘Stop it, stop it, Ravi. Don’t be a baby. Have you hurt yourself?’ Seeing him attended to, the children went back to clasping their hands and chanting ‘The grass is green, the rose is red. . .’ But Ravi would not let them. He tore himself out of his mother’s grasp and pounded across the lawn into their midst, charging at them with his head lowered so that they scattered in surprise. ‘I won, I won, I won,’ he bawled, shaking his head so that the big tears ﬂew. ‘Raghu didn’t find me. I won, I won—’ 1. It took them a minute to grasp what he was saying, even who he was. They had  quite forgotten him. Raghu had found all the others long ago. There had been a fight " about who was to be It next. It had been so ﬁerce that their mother had emerged from her bath and made them change to another game. Then they had played another and another.

The parents had come . out, taken up their positions on the cane chairs. They had begun to play again, sing and v‘ chant. All this time no one had remembered Ravi. Having disappeared from the scene, he had disappeared from their minds. Clean. _  ‘Don’t be a fool,’ Raghu said roughly, pushing him aside, and even Mira said, ‘Stop howling, Ravi. If you want to play, you can stand at the end of the line,’ and she put him 4‘ there very firmly.   7 Games at Twilight 309      The game proceeded. Two pairs of arms reached up and met in an arc. The children “Doped under it again and again in a lugubrious circle, ducking their heads and intoning     ‘The grass is green, The rose is red; Remember me When I am dead, dead, dead, dead . . .’     And the arc of thin arms trembled in the twilight, and the heads were bowed so Sadly, and their feet tramped to that melancholy refrain so mournfully, so helplessly, that Ravi could not bear it. He would not follow them, he would not be included in this funereal game. He had wanted Victory and triumph ~ not a funeral. But he had been forgotten, left out and he would not join them now. The ignominy of being forgotten — how could he face it? He felt his heart go heavy and ache inside him unbearably. He lay down full length on the damp grass, crushing his face into it, no longer crying, silenced by a terrible sense of his insigniﬁcance.
