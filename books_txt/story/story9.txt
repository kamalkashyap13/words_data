The white hair was trapped in the tweezers. I pulled it taut to see if it was gripped tightly, then plucked it.  ‘Aaah!’ grimaced Daddy. ‘Careful, only one at a time.” He continued to read the Times of India, spreading it on the table.  ‘It is only one,’ I said, holding out the tweezers, but my annoyance did not register. Engrossed in the classiﬁeds, he barely looked my way. The naked bulb overhead glanced off the stainless steel tweezers, making a splotch of light dart across the Murphy Radio calendar. It danced over the cherubic features of the Murphy Baby, in step with the tweezers’ progress on Daddy’s scalp. He sighed, turned a page, and went on scrutinising the columns.  Each Sunday, the elimination of white hairs took longer than the last time. I’m sure Daddy noticed it too, but joked bravely that laziness was slowing me down. Percy was always excused from this task. And if I pointed it out, the answer was: your brother’s college studies are more important.  Daddy relied on my nimble fourteen-year-old fingers to uproot the signposts of mortality sprouting week after week. It was unappetising work, combing through his hair greasy with day-old pomade, isolating the white ones, or the ones just beginning to turn — half black and half white, and somehow more repulsive. It was always difficult to decide whether to remove those or let them go till next Sunday, when the whiteness would have spread upward to their tips.  The Sunday edition of the Times of India came with a tabloid of comics: Mandrake the Magician, The Phantom, and Maggie and Jiggs in ‘Bringing Up Father’. The drab yellow tablecloth looked festive with the vivid colours of the comics, as though specially decorated for Sunday. The plastic cloth smelled stale and musty. It was impossible to clean perfectly because of the ﬂoral design embossed upon its surface. The swirly grooves were ideal for trapping all kinds of dirt.  Daddy reached up to scratch a spot on his scalp. His aaah surprised me. He had taught me to be tough, always. One morning when we had come home after cricket, Of White Hairs and Cricket 351  he told Mummy and Mamaiji, ‘Today my son did a brave thing, as I would have done. A powerful shot was going to the boundary, like a cannonball, and he blocked it with his bare shin.’ Those were his exact words. The ball’s shiny red fury, and the audible crack — at least, I think it Was audible — had sent pain racing through me that nearly made my eyes overﬂow. Daddy had clapped and said, ‘Well-ﬁelded, sir, well—fielded.’ So I waited to rub the agonised bone until attention was no longer upon me. I wish Percy had not lost interest in cricket, and had been there. My best friend, Viraf from A Block, was immensely impressed. But that was all a long time ago, many months ago, now Daddy did not take us for cricket on Sunday mornings.  I paused in my search. Daddy had found something in the classifieds and did not notice. By angling the tweezers I could aim the bulb’s light upon various spots on the Murphy Radio calendar: the edges of the picture, worn and turned inward; the threadbare loop of: braid sharing the colour of rust with the rusty nail it hung by; a corroded staple clutching twelve thin strips — the perforated residue of months ripped summarily over a decade ago when their days and weeks were played out. The baby’s smile, posed with finger to chin, was all that had fully endured the years. Mummy and Daddy called it so innocent and joyous. That baby would now be the same age as me. The ragged perimeter of the patch of crumbled wall it tried to hide strayed outward from behind, forming a kind of dark and jagged halo around the baby. The picture grew less adequate, daily, as the wall kept losing plaster and the edges continued to curl and tatter.  Other calendars in the room performed similar enshroudings: the Cement Corporation skyscraper; the Lifebuoy Soap towel-wrapped woman with long black hair; the Parsi calendar, pictureless but showing the English and Parsi names for the months, and the roje in Gujarati beside each date, which Mummy and Mamaiji consulted when reciting their prayers. Aif’these hung well past their designated time span in the world of months and years, covering up the broken promises of the Firozsha Baag building management.  ‘Yes, this is it,’ said Daddy, tapping the paper, ‘get me the scissors.’  Mamar\'ji came out and settled in her chair on the veranda. Seated, there was no trace of the infirmity that caused her to walk doubled over. Doctors said it was due to a weak spine that could not erect against the now inordinate weight of her stomach. From photographs of Mummy’s childhood, I knew Mamaiji had been a big handsome woman, with a majestic countenance. She opened her bag of spinning things, although she had been told to rest her eyes after the recent cataract operation. Then she spied me with the tweezers.  ‘Sunday dawns and he makes the child do that duleendar thing again. It will only bring bad luck.’ She spoke under her breath, arranging her spindle and wool; she was not looking for a direct confrontation. ‘Plucking out hair as if it was a slaughtered chicken. An ill—omened thing, I’m warning you, Sunday after Sunday. But no one listens. Is this anything to make a child do, he should be out playing, or learning how to do bajaar, how to bargain with butcher and bunya.’ She mumbled softly, to allow Daddy to pretend he hadn’t heard a thing.  I resented her speaking against Daddy and calling me a child. She twirled the spindle, drawing fibres into thread from the scrap of wool in her left hand as the spindle descended. I watched, expecting — even wishing — the thread to break. Sometimes it  L , 352 Stories of Ourselves  did, and then it seemed to me that Mamaijz\' was overcome with disbelief, shocked and pained that it could have happened, and I would feel sorry and rush to pick it up for her. The spindle spun to the ﬂoor this time without mishap, hanging by a ﬁne, brand new thread. She hauled it up, winding the thread around the extended thumb and little finger of her left hand by waggling the wrist in little clockwise and counter—clockwise half— turns, while the index and middle fingers clamped tight the source: the shred of wool resembling a lock of her own hair, snow white and slightly tangled.  Mamaiji spun enough thread to keep us all in kustis. Since Grandpa’s death, she spent more and more time spinning, so that now we each had a spare kusti as Well. The kustis were woven by a professional, who always praised the fine quality of the thread; and even at the fire—temple, where we untied and tied them during prayers, they earned the covetous glances of other Parsis.  I beheld the spindle and Mamaiji’s co-ordinated feats of dexterity with admiration. All spinning things entranced me. The descending spindle was like the bucket spinning down into the sacred Bhikha Behram Well to draw water for the ones like us who went there to pray on certain holy days after visiting the ﬁre-temple I imagined myself clinging to the base of the spindle, sinking into the dark well, confident that Mamaiji would pull me up with her waggling hand before I drowned, and praying that the thread would not break. I also liked to stare at records spinning on the old 78-rpm gramophone. There was one I was particularly fond of: its round label was the most ethereal blue I ever saw. The lettering was gold. I played this record over and over, just to watch its wonderfully soothing blue and gold rotation, and the concentric rings of the shiny black shellac, whose grooves created a spiral effect if the light was right. The gramophone cabinet’s warm smell of wood and leather seemed to ﬂy right out of this shellacked spiral, while I sat close, my cheek against it, to feel the hum and vibration of the turntable. It was so cosy and comforting. Like missing school because of a slight cold, staying in bed all day with a book, fussed over by Mummy, eating white rice and soup made specially for me.  Daddy finished cutting out and re-reading the classified advertisement. ‘Yes, this is a good one. Sounds very promising.’ He picked up the newspaper again, then remembered what Mamaiji had muttered, and said softly to me, ‘If it is so duleendar and will bring bad luck, how is it I found this? These old people —’ and gave a sigh of mild exasperation. Then briskly: ‘Don’t stop now, this week is very important.’ He continued, slapping the table merrily at each word: ‘Every—single—white—hair—out.’  There was no real enmity between Daddy and Mamaiji, I think they even liked each other. He was just disinclined towards living with his mother-in—law. They often had disagreements over me, and it was always Mamaiji versus Mummy and Daddy. Mamaz‘ji firmly believed that I was underfed. Housebound as she was, the only food accessible to her was the stuff sold by door-to-door vendors, which I adored but was strictly forbidden: samosa, bhajia, sevganthia; or the dinners she cooked for herself, separately, because she said that Mummy’s cooking was insipidity itself: ‘Tasteless as spit, refuses to go down my throat.’  So I, her favourite, enjoyed from time to time, on the sly, hot searing curries and things she purchased at the door when Daddy was at work and Mummy in the kitchen. Percy shared, too, if he was around; actually, his iron-clad stomach was much better Of White Hairs and Cricket 353  suited to those ﬂaming snacks. But the clandestine repasts were invariably uncovered, and the price was paid in harsh and unpleasant words. Mamaiji was accused of trying to burn to a crisp my stomach and intestines with her fiery, ungodly curries, or of exposing me to dysentery and diphtheria: the cheap door-to—door foodstuff was allegedly cooked in filthy, rancid oil — even machine oil, unfit for human consumption, as was revealed recently by a government investigation. Mamaiji retorted that if they did their duty as parents she would not have to resort to secrecy and chori-chhoopi; as it was, she had no choice, she could not stand by and see the child starve.  All this bothered me much more than I let anyone know. When the arguments started I would say that all the shouting was giving me a headache, and stalk out to the steps of the compound. My guilty conscience, squirming uncontrollably, could not witness the quarrels. For though I was an eager partner in the conspiracy with Mamaiji, and acquiesced to the necessity for secrecy,\'very often I spilled the beans — quite literally — with diarrhoea and vomiting, which Mamaiji upheld as undeniable proof that lack of proper regular nourishment had enfeebled my bowels. In the throes of these bouts of efﬂuence, I promised Mummy and Daddy never again to eat what Mamaiji offered, and confessed all my past sins. In Mamaiji’s eyes I was a traitor, but sometimes it was also fun to listen to her scatological reproaches: ‘Mua ugheeparoa/ Eating my food, then shitting and tattling all over the place. Next time I’ll cork you up with a big bootch before feeding you.’  Mummy came in from the kitchen with a plateful of toast fresh off the Criterion: unevenly browned, and charred in spots by the vagaries of its kerosene wick. She cleared the comics to one side and set the plate down.  ‘Listen to this,’ Daddy said to her, ‘just found it in the paper: “A Growing Concern Seeks Dynamic .Young Account Executive, Self-Motivated. Four-Figure Salary and Provident Fund.” I think it’s perfect.’ He waited for Mummy’s reaction. Then: ‘If I can get it, all our troubles will be over.’  Mummy listened to such advertisements week after week: harbingers of hope that ended in disappointment and frustration. But she always allowed the initial wave of optimism to lift her, riding it with Daddy and me, higher and higher, making plans and dreaming, until it crashed and left us stranded, awaiting the next advertisement and the next wave. So her silence was surprising.  Daddy reached for a toast and dipped it in the tea, wrinkling his nose, ‘Smells of kerosene again. When I get this job, first thing will be a proper toaster. No more making burnt toast on top of the Criterion.’  ‘I cannot smell kerosene,’ said Mummy.  ‘Smell this then,’ he said, thrusting the tea—soaked piece at her nose, ‘smell it and tell me,’ irritated by her ready contradiction. ‘It’s these useless wicks. The original Criterion ones from England used to be so good. One trim and you had a ﬁne ﬂame for months.’ He bit queasily into the toast. ‘Well, when I get the job, a Bombay Gas Company stove and cylinder can replace it.’ He laughed. ‘Why not? The British left seventeen years ago, time for their stove to go as well.’  He finished chewing and turned to me. ‘And one day, you must go, too, to America. No future here.’ His eyes fixed mine, urgently. ‘Somehow we’ll get the money to send you. I’ll find a way.’ 354 Stories of Ourselves  His face ﬁlled with love. I felt suddenly like hugging him, but we never did except on birthdays, and to get rid of the feeling I looked away and pretended to myself that he was saying it just to humour me, because he wanted me to ﬁnish pulling his white hairs Fortunately, his jovial optimism returned.  ‘Maybe even a fridge is possible, then we will never have to go upstairs to that woman. No more obligations, no more favours. You won’t have to kill any more rats for her.’ Daddy waited for us to join in. For his sake I hoped that Mummy would. I did not feel like mustering any enthusiasm.  But she said sharply. ‘All your shaik-chullee thoughts are flying again. Nothing happens when you plan too much. Leave it in the hands of God.’  Daddy was taken aback. He said, summoning bitterness to retaliate, ‘You are thinking I will never get a better job? I’ll show all of you.’ He threw his piece of toast onto the plate and sat back. But he recovered as quickly, and made it into a joke. He picked up the newspaper. ‘Well, I’ll just have to surprise you one day when I throw out the kerosene stoves.’  I liked the kerosene stoves and the formidable fifteen-gallon storage drum that replenished them. The Criterion had a little round glass window in one corner of its black base, and I would peer into the murky depths, watching the level rise as kerosene poured through the funnel; it was very dark and cool and mysterious in there, then the kerosene ﬂoated up and its surface shone under the light bulb. Looking inside was like lying on Chaupatty beach at night and gazing at the stars, in the hot season, while we stayed out after dinner till the breeze could rise and cool off the walls baking all day in the sun. When the stove was lit and the kitchen dark, the soft orange glow through its little mica door reminded me of the glow in the fire-temple afargaan, when there wasn’t a blazing fire because hardly any sandalwood offerings had been left in the silver thaali; most people came only on the holy days. The Primus stove was fun, too, pumped up hot and roaring, the kerosene emerging under pressure and igniting into sharp blue ﬂames.’ Daddy was the only one who lit it; every year, many women died in their kitchens because of explosions, and Daddy said that though many of them were not accidents, especially the dowry cases, it was still a dangerous stove if handled improperly.  Mummy went back to the kitchen. I did not mind the kerosene smell, and ate some toast, trying to imagine the kitchen without the stoves, with squat red gas cylinders sitting under the table instead. I had seen them in shop windows, and I thought they were ugly. We would get used to them, though, like everything else. At night, I stood on the veranda sometimes to look at the stars. But it was not the same as going to Chaupatty and lying on the sand, quietly, with only the sound of the waves in the dark. On Saturday nights, I would make sure that the stoves were filled, because Mummy made a very early breakfast for Daddy and me next morning. The milk and bread would be arriving in the pre-dawn darkness while the kettle was boiling and we got ready for cricket with the boys of Firozsha Baag.  We always left by seven o’clock. The rest of the building was just starting to wake up: Nariman Hansotia would be aligning, on the parapet of his ground ﬂoor veranda, his razor and shaving brush and mirror beside two steaming cups, one of boiling water and Of White Hairs and Cricket 355  the other of tea, and we often wondered if he ever dipped the brush in the wrong cup; and the old spinster Tehmina, still waiting for her cataracts to ripen, would be saying her prayers facing the rising sun, with her duster-coat hoisted up and slung over the left shoulder, her yellowing petticoat revealed, to untie and tie her thick rope—like kusti around the waist; and the kuchrawalli would be sweeping the compound, making her rounds from door to door with broom and basket, collecting yesterday’s garbage. If she happened to cross Tehmina’s line of vision, all the boys were sure to have a fine time, because Tehmina, though blurry with cataracts, would recognise the kuchrawalli and let loose at her with a stream of curses fouler than any filth in the garbage basket, for committing the unspeakable crime of passing in front of her, thereby polluting her prayers and vitiating their efficacy.  Even Daddy laughed, but he hurried us along as we lingered there to follow the ensuing dialogue. We picked our way through sleeping streets. The pavement dwellers would stretch, and look for a place to relieve themselves. Then they would fold up their cardboard pieces and roll away their plastics before the street sweepers arrived and the traffic got heavy. Sometimes, they would start a small ﬁre if they had something to cook for breakfast, or else try to beg from people who came to the Irani restaurant for their morning chai and bun. Occasionally, Mummy would wrap up leftovers from the night before for Daddy and me to distribute to them along the way.  It had been such a long time since we last played cricket. Flying kites had also become a thing of the past. One by one, the things I held dear were leaving my life, I thought gloomily. And Francis. What about poor Francis? Where was he now, I wondered. I wished he was still working in the Baag. That awful thrashing he got in Tar Gully was the faulqtL of Najamai and Tehmina, those stupid old women. And Najamai saying he stole eighty rupees was nonsense, in my opinion; the absent-minded cow must have forgotten where she left the money.  I put down the tweezers and reached for the comics. Daddy looked up. ‘Don’t stop now, it should be perfect this week. There will be an interview or something.’  Avoiding his eye, I said stolidly, ‘I’m going to read the comics,” and walked out to the compound steps. When I turned at the doorway Daddy was still looking at me. His face was like Mamaiji’s when the thread broke and slipped through her fingers and the spindle fell to the ﬂoor. But I kept walking, it was a matter of pride. You always did what you said you were going to do.  The comics did not take long. It used to be more fun when Daddy and I had a race to the door to grab the Times, and pretended to fight over who would read the comics first. I thought of the lines on Daddy’s forehead, visible so clearly from my coign of vantage with the tweezers. His thinning hair barely gave off a dull lustre with its day-old pomade, and the Sunday morning stubble on his chin was ﬂecked with grey and white.  Something — remorse, maybe just pity — stirred inside, but I quashed it without ﬁnding out. All my friends had fathers whose hair was greying. Surely they did not spend Sunday mornings doing what I did, or they would have said something. They were not like me, there was nothing that was too private and personal for them. They would talk about anything. Especially Pesi. He used to describe for us how his father passed gas, 356 Stories of Ourselves                                                                               enhancing the narrative with authentic sound effects. Now he was in boardin His father was dead.  From our C Block stone steps I could observe the entire length of the compound, up to A Block at the far end. Dr Sidhwa’s black Fiat turned in at the gate and trundled laboriously over the rough-hewn ﬂagstones of Firozsha Baag. He waved as he went past. He looked so much like Pesi’s father. He had the same crow’s—feet at the corners of his eyes that Dr Mody used to have, and even their old cars seemed identical, except that Dr Mody healed animals and Dr Sidhwa, humans. Most of us had been treated by him at one time or another. His house and dispensary were within walking distance of Firozsha Baag, even a sick person’s walking distance; he was a steadfast Parsi, seen often at fire-temples; and he always drove over for his house—calls. What more could we want in a doctor?  The car stopped at the far end of the compound. Dr Sidhwa heaved out, he was a portly man, and reached in for his bag. It must be an emergency in A Block, I decided, for someone to call him on Sunday. He slammed the door, then opened and slammed it again, harder now. The impact rocked the old car a little, but the door shut properly this time. Viraf emerged from the steps of A Block. I waved to him to let him know I was waiting.  Viraf was my best friend. Together we learned bicycling, on a rented contraption of bent spokes and patchwork tyres from Cecil Cycles of Tar Gully: Fifty Paise Per Hour. Daddy used to take us to practise at Chaupatty on the wide pavements by the beach. They were deserted in the early morning — pavement dwellers preferred the narrow side streets — except for pigeons gathering in anticipation of the pigeon-man, who arrived when the streets stirred to life. We took turns, and Daddy ran behind, holding the seat to keep us steady. Daddy also taught the two of us to play cricket. Mummy had been angry when he brought home the bat and ball, asking where the money had come from. His specialty on his own sghool team had been bowling, and he taught us the leg break and off break, and told us about the legendary Jasu Patel, born with a defective wrist which turned out to be perfect for spin bowling, and how Jasu had mastered the dreaded curl spin which was eventually feared by all the great international batsmen.  Cricket on Sunday mornings became a regular event for the boys in Firozsha Baag. Between us we almost had a complete kit; all that was missing was a pair of bails, and wicket-keeping gloves. Daddy took anyone who wanted to play to the Marine Drive maidaan, and organised us into teams, captaining one team himself. We went early, before the sun got too hot and the maidaan overcrowded. But then one Sunday, halfway through the game, Daddy said he was going to rest for a while. Sitting on the grass a little distance away, he seemed so much older than he did when he was batting, or bowling leg breaks. He watched us with a faraway expression on his face. Sadly, as if he had just realised something and wished he hadn’t.  There was no cricket at the maidaan after that day. Since we were not allowed to go alone, our games were now confined to the Firozsha Baag compound. Its flagstoned surface would not accept the points of stumps, and we chalked three white lines on the compound’s black stone wall. But the compound was too cramped for cricket. Besides, the uneven ground made the ball bounce and rear erratically. After a few shattered panes of glass and several complaints from neighbours, the games ceased.  g—school. Of White Hairs and Cricket 357  I waved again to Viraf and gave our private Signal, ‘00 000 00 ooo,’ which was  like a yodel. He waved back, then took the doctor’s bag and accompanied him into A l Block. His polite demeanour made me smile. That Viraf. Shrewd fellow, he knew the . things to do to make grown—ups approve of him, and was always welcome at all the 3 homes in Firozsha Baag. He would be back soon. ‘ I waited for at least half an hour. I cracked all my fingers and knuckles, even the \' thumbs. Then I went to the other end of the compound. After sitting on the steps there for a few minutes, I got impatient and climbed upstairs to find out why Viraf was buttering up the doctor.  But Dr Sidhwa Was on his way down, carrying his black bag. I said, ‘Sahibji,  doctor,’ and he smiled at me as I raced up to the third ﬂoor. Viraf was standing at the balcony outside his ﬂat. ‘What’s all the muskaa-paalis for the doctor?’  He turned away without answering. He looked upset but I did not ask what the matter was. Words to show concern were always beyond me. I spoke again, in that easygoing debonair style which all of us tried to perfect, right arm akimbo and head tilted ever so slightly, ‘Come on yaar, what are your plans for today?’  He Shrugged his shoulders, and I persisted, ‘Half the morning’s over, man, don’t be such a cry-baby.’  ‘FiSh off,’ he said, but his voice shook. His eyes were red, and he rubbed one as if there was something in it. I stood quietly for a while, looking out over the balcony. His third-ﬂoor balcony was my favourite spot, you could see the road beyond Firozsha Baag, and sometimes, on a sunny day, even a corner of Chaupatty beach with the sun  gleaming 0n the waves. From my ground ﬂoOr veranda the compound’s black stone wall was all that was visible.     where some A Blockgleighbours had gathered around Viraf’s mother. ‘How about Ludo or Snakes-land-Ladders?’ I tried. If he shrugged again I planned to leave. What else could I do? ‘Okay,’ he said, ‘but stay quiet. If Mumma sees us she’ll send us out.’ i No one saw as we tiptoed inside, they were absorbed in whatever the discussion i" was about. ‘Puppa is very sick,’ whispered Viraf, as we passed the sickroom. I stopped and looked inside. It was dark. The smell of sickness and medicines made it stink like h the waiting room of Dr Sidhwa’s dispensary. Viraf’s father was in bed, lying on his back, l r with a tube through his nose. There was a long needle stuck into his right arm, and it  glinted cruelly in a thin shaft of sunlight that had suddenly slunk inside the darkened 1: room. I shivered. The needle was connected by a tube to a large bottle which hung upSide down from a dark metal stand towering over the bed. Viraf’s mother was talking softly to the neighbours in the dining-room. ‘. . . in his chest got worse when he came home last night. So many times I’ve told him, three ﬂoors to climb is not easy at your age with your big body, climb one, take rest for a few minutes, then climb again. But he won’t listen, does not want people to think it is  too much for him. Now this is the result, and what I will do I don’t know. Poor little Viraf, being so brave when the doctor . . .’  L.__‘ 358 Stories of Ourselves  Supine, his rotundity had spread into a ﬂatness denying the huge bulk. I remembered calling Viraf a cry—baby, and my face ﬂushed with shame. I swore I would apologise_ Daddy was slim and wiry, although there were the beginnings of a small pot, as Mummy called it. He used to run and field with us at cricket. Viraf’s father had sat on the grass the one time he took us. The breath came loud and rasping. His mouth was a bit Open, It resembled a person snoring, but was uneven, and the sound suggested pain. I noticed the lines on his brow, like Daddy’s, only Daddy’s were less deep.  Over the rasp of his breath came the voice of Viraf’s mother. ‘. . . to exchange with someone on the ground ﬂoor, but that also is no. Says I won’t give up my third—ﬂoor paradise for all the smell and noise of a ground—ﬂoor ﬂat. Which is true, up here even B.E.S.T. bus rattle and rumble does not come. But what use of paradise if you are not alive in good health to enjoy it? Now doctor says intensive care but Parsi General Hospital has no place. Better to stay here than other hospitals, only . . .’  My eyes fixed on the stone-grey face of Viraf’s father, I backed out of the sickroom, unseen. The hallway was empty. Viraf was waiting for me in the back room with the boards for Ludo and Snakes-and—Ladders. But I sneaked through the veranda and down the stairs without a word.  The compound was ﬂooded in sunshine as I returned to the other end. On the way I passed the three white stumps we had once chalked on the compound wall’s black  Mummy was in the kitchen, I could hear the roaring of the Primus stove. Mamaiji, sinister in her dark glasses, sat by the veranda window, sunlight reﬂecting off the thick, black lenses with leather blinders at the sides; after her cataract operation the doctor had told her to wear these for a few months.  Daddy was still reading‘J‘the Times at the dining-table. Through the gloom of the light bulb I saw the Murphy Baby’s innocent and joyous smile. I wondered what he looked like now. When I was two years old, there was 3. Murphy Baby Contest, and according to Mummy and Daddy my photograph, which had been entered, should have won. They said that in those days my smile had been just as, if not more, innocent and joyous.  The tweezers were lying on the table. I picked them up. They glinted pitilessly, like that long needle in Viraf’s father. I dropped them with a shudder, and they clattered against the table.  Daddy looked up questioningly. His hair was dishevelled as I had left it, and I waited, hoping he would ask me to continue. To offer to do it was beyond me, but I wanted desperately that he should ask me now. I glanced at his face discreetly, from the corner of my eye. The lines on his forehead stood out all too clearly, and the stubble ﬂecked with white, which by this hour should have disappeared down the drain with the shaving water. I swore to myself that never again would I begrudge him my help; I would get all the white hairs, one by one, if he would only ask me; I would concentrate on the tweezers as never before, I would do it as if all our lives were riding on the efﬁcacy of the tweezers, yes, I would continue to do it Sunday after Sunday, no matter how long it took. Of White Hairs and Cricket 359  Daddy put down the newspaper and removed his glasses. He rubbed his eyes, then went to the bathroom. How tired he looked, and how his shoulders drooped; his gait lacked confidence, and I’d never noticed that before. He did not speak to me even though I was praying hard that he would. Something inside me grew very heavy, and I tried to swallow, to dissolve that heaviness in saliva, but swallowing wasn’t easy either, the heaviness was blocking my throat.  I heard the sound of running water. Daddy was preparing to shave I wanted to go and watch him, talk to him, laugh with him at the funny faces he made to get at all the tricky places with the razor, especially the cleft in his chin.  Instead, I threw myself on the bed. I felt like crying, and buried my face in the pillow. I wanted to cry for the way I had treated Viraf, and for his sick father with the long, cold needle in his arm and his rasping breath; for Mamaiji and her tired, darkened eyes spinning thread for our kustis, and for Mummy growing old in the dingy kitchen smelling of kerosene, where the Primus roared and her dreams were extinguished; I wanted to weep for myself, for not being able to hug Daddy when I wanted to, and for not ever saying thank you for cricket in the morning, and pigeons and bicycles and dreams; and for all the white hairs that I was powerless to stop.
