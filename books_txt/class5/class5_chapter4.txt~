Well, you have opened my book. You have turned the page. You are now in ancient Greece, and you are standing on my mountain.  You had better come up.  No, I am not a ghost.  No, I am not a giant.  I am a god. Yes, a god!  But come up higher, so we don’t have to shout. I am tired of shouting.
Steep, isn’t it? Too steep for most people. And the air is so thin, you may get out of breath. Take your time. I’m in no hurry.
There! You made it! Welcome! Welcome to Mount Olympus. Have you ever climbed so high? Or looked out across such vast distances? Or stood so far above the Earth?

Sit down! Choose a rock and make yourself comfortable. And now I will tell you who I am I am Zeus,the great god, Zeus, the greatest of all the gods.  Zeus the all-bright, they call me. Zeus, the bringer of light. Yes, I am Zeus, and I rule over all other gods and goddesses. There now, up in the sky are two of my children: Apollo wheeling the sun away till tomorrow morning, and Artemis rolling out the moon.  And the winged horse over there?  That’s Pegasus.
He takes me in my chariot wherever I want to go. I’ll tell you more about him and Apollo and Artemis later.

Once upon a time, there was a cat, a wild cat, who lived all by herself out in the bush. After a while she got tired of living alone and took herself a husband, another wild cat who thought she was the ﬁnest creature in all the jungle.
One day, as they strolled together along the path through the tall grass, swish, out of the grass jumped Leopard, and Cat’s husband was bowled over, all fur and claws, into the dust.
"O-oh!” said Cat. “I see my husband is covered in dust and is not the ﬁnest creature in the jungle. It is Leopard.”  So Cat went to live with Leopard.
They lived very happily together until one day, as they were hunting in the bush, suddenly — whoosh — out of the shadows leapt Lion, right onto Leopard’s back and ate him all up.

“O-o-oh!” said Cat. “I see Leopard is  not the ﬁnest creature in all the jungle. It is Lion.”

So Cat went to live with Lion. They lived together very happily until one day, as they were stalking through the forest, a large shape loomed overhead, and — fu-chu — Elephant put one foot on top of Lion and squashed him ﬂat.
“O-o-o-oh!” said Cat. “I see Lion is not the ﬁnest creature in all the jungle. It is Elephant.”
So Cat went to live with Elephant. She climbed up onto his back and sat purring on his neck, right between his two ears.
They lived together very happily until one day, as they were moving through the tall reeds down by the river — pa-wa! — there was a loud bang, and Elephant sank down onto the ground.
Cat looked around and all she could see was a small man with a gun. "O—o-o-o-oh!” said Cat. "I see Elephant is not the finest creature in all the jungles. It is Man.”

So Cat walked after Man all the way to his home, and jumped up onto the thatch of his hut.  ” At last, " said Cat, “I have found the ﬁnest creature in all the jungle.”

She lived up in the thatch hut very happily and began to catch the mice and the rats which lived in the village. Until one day, as she sat on the roof warming herself in the sun, she heard a noise from inside the hut. The voices of Man and his wife grew louder and louder until — wara - wara -wara  yo-we! — out came Man, tumbling head over heels into the dust. “Aha!” said Cat. “Now I do know  who is truly the ﬁnest creature in all the  jungle. It is Woman."  Cat came down from the thatch, went inside the but and sat by the ﬁre.  And that’s where she’s been ever since.


Sometimes, King Hrothgar would return alone to his beloved Heorot. He would sit on his raised dais, drawing patterns in the dust with one finger. Then he would search with his eyes to see memories of firelight in the darkness and strain with his ears to hear echoes of laughter in the silence. He was an old man now. Twelve whole winters had passed since Grendel had come to plague him.
 It was at Heorot that he met Beowulf.
He was sitting in his chair, muttering to himself, when the door of the banqueting hall crashed open. He squinted as bright sunlight flooded in, capturing a million motes of dust within its golden beams. A figure stepped forward, silhouetted against the light which could almost have been emanating from his own body. The dust formed a shimmering aura around him. The King trembled. Never had he seen a warrior so tall, so strong.
The stranger approached and fell onto one knee. He was dressed in a blue cloak over a silvery mail-shirt. In one hand he carried a richly decorated shield, in the other a Spear. His helmet masked his face but it could not hide the fair hair that tumbled down onto his shoulders nor the bright blue eyes that shone despite the shadows.

“Your majesty!” the ﬁgure said.
“Who are you?” Hrothgar demanded, recovering himself.
“My name is Beowulf, ” the warrior replied. "I come from the land of the Geats.  I have crossed a great sea to come before you, to serve you. And I do not come alone."
There was a movement at the door and fourteen more men entered the hall, bringing with them — or so it seemed to the old king — the light that had for so long been absent. As one they knelt before him, forming a semi-circle around his throne.
“We are soldiers of King Hygelac,” Beowulf continued. “My noble father was Edgetheow, a famous ﬁghter among the Geats, I too have found fame in my lifetime, and seek to add to that fame by destroying the beast that has emptied this most stately hall. My sovereign, ever a friend of the Danes, bids me wish all health to your majesty. He too will be glad to see this monster die.”
“Noble Beowulf!" the king replied. “Well is your name known to me — and that of your father. I bid you welcome. But this creature has already taken ninety of my ﬁnest warriors. I fear your quest is hopeless.”
“Not so!" Beowulf said with a grim smile. “Tonight, as we feast once again in great Heorot, I will tell you something of my past exploits which will remove your fears for the present."
