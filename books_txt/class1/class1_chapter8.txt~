Next they saw the big roundabout. Then they found the Slide and Glide A girl came down very fast and splashed. At the end of the day they were tired so they sat in a cafe and rested. They both had a drink with a straw Poly got a Cloud nine birthday bag. It was a fantastic day out and they felt very happy.
