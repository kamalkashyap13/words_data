The morning I was to go to school for the first time, I woke up in a blackness as mysterious as the heart of a dark forest, the sounds nearby its strange beat. But the howl of a wolf way out in the country gave me my bearings.
I took up my little notebook, and a small stub of pencil, my only academic possessions. How long would they last? How small could I write?
I quickly got dressed, as warmly as I could, although deep winter had not yet arrived. On went my one and only coat. I was ready to go. It never occurred to me that for a child to walk alone down a deserted Siberian road, so obviously a stranger, required some courage. I was too busy trying to rehearse the Russian alphabet I would need to know in my new school.
In room number five, a few children in caps and coats were seated at their desks watching the teacher write on the blackboard. She turned when I came in and looked at me so severely my heart sank.
‘You must be Esther Rudomin. From Poland. Your Russian will be poor. ’ It was as if she was reading from a dossier that would determine some sort of punishment. ‘It will be my task to see that you improve it. My name is Raisa Nikitovna. Go to the last desk of the third row and sit down. ’
Without another word, she picked up a book, and called out a page number. Everyone had a book but me. The feeling must have been something like being the only soldier without a gun. I leaned towards the girl next to me and asked if I might share her book. She grudgingly agreed. She was a very pretty girl with short blonde hair, and eyes the special blue of northern countries. I asked her name, but she told me to be quiet; there was absolutely no talking allowed in class.
My first lesson in school in Siberia was memorable for being a chilly one. It was not only the Russian author’s meaning that evaded me, lost as it was in a sea of strange letters formed in the


 Russian alphabet, but so did the book itself —— literally. My classmate somehow managed to keep slipping it out of my field of Vision, which forced me to strain, squirm, and nudge her to bring the book closer. Naturally, I had barely read the first paragraph when Raisa Nikitovna began to quiz the class. To my horror, one question was directed at me. As I began to answer in my halting Russian, all the children turned to stare at me.  When the lesson was finished, Raisa Nikitovna introduced me and said that I would share my books with Svetlana. Svetlana turned out to be the pretty girl sitting next to me; the prospect of sharing with her was not heartening. The more attention I got in class, the more she sulked. I sensed that Svetlana wanted to be the queen bee and that I had become her natural enemy. This was confirmed when I asked if I might come to her house and study with her. The answer was a sharp ‘No!’. I would be allowed to go there to fetch books when she had quite finished with them, but otherwise I could jolly well trot home and study alone.  At the end of my first day at school, I went home and collapsed on the sofa. Out of the confusion of the day, three giants emerged to be slain: Svetlana, Raisa Nikitovna, and the Russian alphabet.


The morning came when my sisters surrounded me, wrapped me in scarves, tied up my bootlaces, thrust a cap on my head, and stuffed a baked potato in my pocket.
‘What’s this? ’ I said.  ‘You’re starting school today. ’  ‘I ain’t. I’m stopping ’ ome. ’  ‘You are. ’  ‘Boo-hoo.’  I arrived at the school just three feet tall and fatly wrapped in my scarves. The playground roared like a rodeo and the potato burned through my thigh. Old boots, ragged stockings, torn trousers and skirts, went sailing and skidding around me. The rabble closed in; l was encircled; grit ﬂew in my face like shrapnel. Tall girls with frizzlecl hair, and huge boys with sharp elbows, began to prod me with hideous interest. They plucked at  my scarves, spun me round like a top, screwed my nose and stole my potato.

To a mind of ﬂint, the teacher must be iron, and strike sparks. To the empty pitcher, the teacher becomes a well. To the fallow mind, a planter of seeds. To the cluttered mind, a gardener to weed, shape, and clear a space for growing.  To the lens, the teacher is light, and to the mind of light, a lens. To the sleeper, the teacher is the wake-up call of birds at sunrise. To clay, the teacher is potter, sculptor, and trainer in self-shaping. To the wanderer, the teacher is a knowing guide. To the developed mind, the teacher is colleague, listener, friend.  To all, the teacher is a mirror that shows not only the self but the path and its choices, the task and its demands — the difficulties, the joys. To all and from all, the teacher is a learner, a person —— and a  prism through which the ordinary continuously reveals itself to be miraculous.

 Towards the end of December, my mother came over on the paddle — boat to take me and my trunk home for the Christmas holidays. Oh the bliss and wonder of being with the family once again after all those weeks of fierce discipline! Unless you have been to boarding — school when you are very young, it is absolutely impossible to appreciate the delights of living at home. It is almost worth going away because it’s so lovely coming back.  I could hardly believe that I didn’t have to wash in cold water in the mornings or keep silent in the corridors, or say ‘ Sir ’ to every grown-up man I met,  or get ﬂicked with wet towels in the changing-room, or eat porridge for breakfast that seemed to be full of little round lumpy grey sheep-droppings,  or walk all daylong in perpetual fear of the long yellow cane that lay on  top of the corner-cupboard in the Headmaster’s study.

A million billion willion miles from home

Waiting for the bell to go. (To go where?)

Why are they all so big, other children?

So noisy? So much at home they

Must have been born in uniform

Lived all their lives in playgrounds

Spent the years inventing games

That don’t let me in. Games

That are rough, that swallow you up.
And the railings.

All around, the railings.

Are they to keep out wolves and monsters?
Things that carry off and eat children?
Things you don’t take sweets from?
Perhaps they’re to stop us getting out
Running away from the lessins. Lessin.
What does a lessin look like?

Sounds small and slimy.

They keep them in the glassrooms.
Whole rooms made out of glass. Imagine.
I wish I could remember my name
Mummy said it would come in useful.
Like wellies. When there’s puddles.
Yellowwellies. I wish she was here. 1
I think my name is sewn on somewhere
Perhaps the teacher will read it for me.
Tea-Cher. The one who makes the tea.
