Ming was resting comfortably on the foot of his mistress’ bunk, when the man picked him up by the back of the neck, stuck him out on the deck and closed the cabin door. Ming’s blue eyes widened in shock and brief anger, then nearly closed again because of the brilliant sunlight. It was not the first time Ming had been thrust out of the cabin rudely, and Ming realised that the man did it when his mistress, Elaine, was not looking.  The sailboat now offered no shelter from the sun, but Ming was not yet too warm. He leapt easily to the cabin roof and stepped onto the coil of rope just behind the mast. Ming liked the rope coil as a couch, because he could see everything from the height, the cup shape of the rope protected him from strong breezes, and also minimised the swaying and sudden changes of angle of the White Lark, since it was more or less the centre point. But just now the sail had been taken down, because Elaine and the man had eatenllunch, and often they had a siesta afterward, during which time, Ming knew, the man didn’t like him in the cabin. Lunchtime was all right. In fact, Ming had just lunched on delicious grilled ﬁsh and a bit of lobster. Now, lying in a relaxed curve on the tail of rope, Ming opened his mouth in a great yawn, then with his slant eyes almost closed against the strong sunlight, gazed at the beige hills and the white and pink houses and hotels that circled the bay of Acapulco. Between the White Lark and the shore where people plashed inaudibly, the sun twinkled on the water’s surface like thousands of tiny electric lights going on and off. A water—skier went by, skimming up white spray behind him. Such activity! Ming half dozed, feeling the heat of the sun sink into his fur. Ming was from New York, and he considered Acapulco a great improvement over his environment in the first weeks of his life. He remembered a sunless box with straw 0n the bottom, three or four of her kittens in with him, and a window behind which giant forms paused for a few moments, tried to catch his attention by tapping, then passed on. He did not remember his mother at all. One day a young woman who smelled 0f something pleasant came into the place and took him away — away from the ugly, frightening smell of dogs, of medicine and parrot dung. Then they went on what Ming now knew was an aeroplane. He was quite used to aeroplanes now and rather liked Ming’s Biggest Prey 279  them. On aeroplanes he sat on Elaine’s lap, or slept on her lap, and there were always  Ming had perfect freedom to wander out into the patio behind the shop, or to sleep in his basket in a corner. There was more sunlight in front of the shop, but mischievous  their house, people who spent the night, people by the score who stayed up very late eating and drinking, playing the gramophone or the piano — people who separated him from Elaine. People who stepped on his toes, people who sometimes picked him up from behind before he could do anything about it, so that he had to squirm and fight to get free, people who stroked him roughly, people who closed a door somewhere, locking him  in. People! Ming detested people. In all the world, he liked only Elaine. Elaine loved him and understood him.  lately. Ming did not like the way Teddie looked at him, when Elaine was not watching. And sometimes Teddie, when Elaine was not near, muttered something which Ming knew was a threat. Or a command to leave the room. Ming took it calmly. Dignity was to be preserved. Besides, wasn’t his mistress on his side? The man was the intruder.  him in her arms, and took him below into the suddenly cool shade of the cabin. She was talking to the man, and not in a gentle tone. She set Ming down in front of his dish of  water, and though he was not thirsty, he drank a little to please her. Ming did feel addled by the heat, and he staggered a little.  Elaine took a wet towel and wiped Ming’s face, his ears and his four paws. Then She laid him gently on the bunk that smelled of Elaine’s perfume but also of the man Whom Ming detested.  Now his mistress and the man were quarrelling. Ming could tell from the tone. Elaine was staying with Ming, sitting on the edge of the bunk. Ming at last heard the Splash that meant Teddie had dived into the water. Ming hoped he stayed there, hoped 280 Stories of Ourselves  But soon there was another plash and plop, Teddie’s wet feet on the deck, and Ming was awake again.  The tone of quarrelling recommenced. Elaine went up the few steps onto the deck. Ming, tense but with his chin still resting on the moist bathtowel, kept his eyes on the cabin door. It was Teddie’s feet that he heard descending. Ming lifted his head slightly, aware that there was no exit behind him, that he was trapped in the cabin. The man paused with a towel in his hands, staring at Ming.  Ming relaxed completely, as he might do preparatory to a yawn, and this caused his eyes to cross. Ming then let his tongue slide a little way out of his mouth. The man started to say something, looked as if he wanted to hurl the wadded towel at Ming, but he wavered, whatever he had been going to say never got out of his mouth, and he threw the towel in the sink, then bent to wash his face. It was not the first time Ming had let his tongue slide out at Teddie. Lots of people laughed when Ming did this, if they were people at a party, for instance, and Ming rather enjoyed that. But Ming sensed that Teddie took it as a hostile gesture of some kind, which was why Ming did it deliberately to Teddie, whereas among other people, it was often an accident when Ming’s tongue slid out.  The quarrelling continued. Elaine made coffee. Ming began to feel better, and went on deck again, because the sun had now set. Elaine had started the motor, and they were gliding slowly toward the shore. Ming caught the song of birds, the odd screams like shrill phrases of certain birds that cried only at sunset. Ming looked forward to the adobe house on the cliff that was his and his mistress’ home. He knew that the reason she did not leave him at home (where he would have been more comfortable) when she went on the boat, was because she was afraid that people might trap him, even kill him. Ming understood. People had tried to grab him from’almost under Elaine’s eyes. Once he had been all the way in a cloth bag suddenly, and though ﬁghting as hard as he could, he was not sure he would have been able to get out, if Elaine had not hit the boy herself and grabbed the bag from him.  Ming had intended to jump up on the cabin roof again, but after glancing at it, he decided to save his strength, so he crouched on the warm, gently sloping deck with his feet tucked in, and gazed at the approaching shore. Now he could hear guitar music from the beach. The voices of his mistress and the man had come to a halt. For a few moments, the loudest sound was the chug—chug—chug of the boat’s motor. Then Ming heard the man’s bare feet climbing the cabin steps. Ming did not turn his head to look at him, but his ears twitched back a little, involuntarily. Ming looked at the water just the distance of a short leap in front of him and below him. Strangely, there was no sound from the man behind him. The hair on Ming’s neck prickled, and Ming glanced over hiS right shoulder.  At that instant, the man bent forward and rushed at Ming with his arms outspread-  Ming was on his feet at once, darting straight toward the man which was the only direction of safety on the railless deck, and the man swung his left arm and cuffed Ming in the chest. Ming went ﬂying backward, claws scraping the deck, but his hind legs Went over the edge. Ming clung with his front feet to the sleek wood which gave him little                         ‘fmmwwréa’rrrgwm w  .1, it, Ming’s Biggest Prey 281  hold, while his hind legs worked to heave him up, worked at the Side of the boat which sloped to Ming’s disadvantage.  The man advanced to shove a foot against Ming’s paws, but Elaine came up the cabin steps just then.  ‘What’s happening? Ming!’  Ming’s strong hind legs were getting him onto the deck little by little. The man had knelt as if to lend a hand. Elaine had fallen onto her knees, also, and had Ming by the back of the neck now.  Ming relaxed, hunched on the deck. His tail was wet.  ‘He fell overboard!’ Teddie said. ‘It’s true he’s groggy. Just lurched over and fell when the boat gave a dip.’  ‘It’s the sun. Poor Ming!’ Elaine held the cat.  The man came down into the cabin. Elaine had Ming on the bunk and was talking  Here were the friends and allies of Teddie, whom Ming detested by association, although these were merely Mexican boys. Two or three boys in shorts called ‘Seﬁor Teddie!’ and offered a hand to Elaine to climb onto the dock, took the rope attached to the front of the boat, offered to carry ‘Ming! 4 Ming!’ Ming leapt onto the dock himself and crouched, waiting for Elaine, ready to dart away from any other hand that might  walked away. A boy took the things Elaine was carrying, then she picked Ming up. They got into the big car without a roof that belonged to Teddie, and drove up the winding road toward Elaine’s and Ming’s house. One of the boys was driving. Now the  ‘Well, well,’ said the man, pretending to be amused, and took his hand away.  Elaine’s voice had stopped in the middle of something she was saying. Ming was tired, and wanted nothing more than to take a nap on the big bed at home. The bed Was covered with a red and white striped blanket of thin wool.  Hardly had Ming thought of this, when he found himself in the cool, fragrant atmosphere of his own home, being lowered gently onto the bed with the soft woollen COver. His mistress kissed his cheek, and said something with the word hungry in it. Ming understood, at any rate. He was to tell her when he was hungry. 282 Stories of Ourselves  Ming dozed, and awakened at the sound of voices on the terrace a couple of yards away, past the open glass doors. Now it was dark. Ming could see one end of the table, and could tell from the quality of the light that there were candles on the table. Concha, the servant who slept in the house, was clearing the table. Ming heard her voice, then the voices of Elaine and the man. Ming smelled cigar smoke. Ming jumped to the floor and sat for a moment looking out the door toward the terrace. He yawned, then arched his back and stretched, and limbered up his muscles by digging his claws into the thick straw carpet. Then he slipped out to the right on the terrace and glided silently down the long stairway of broad stones to the garden below. The garden was like a jungle or a forest. Avocado trees and mango trees grew as high as the terrace itself, there were bougainvilleas against the wall, orchids in the trees, and magnolias and several camellias which Elaine had planted. Ming could hear birds twittering and stirring in their nests. Sometimes he climbed trees to get at their nests, but tonight he was not in the mood, though he was no longer tired. The voices of his mistress and the man disturbed him. His mistress was not a friend of the man’s tonight, that was plain.  Concha was probably still in the kitchen, and Ming decided to go in and ask her for something to eat. Concha liked him. One maid who had not liked him had been dismissed by Elaine. Ming thought he fancied barbecued pork. That was what his mistress and the man had eaten tonight. The breeze blew fresh from the ocean, rufﬂing Ming’s fur slightly. Ming felt completely recovered from the awful experience of nearly falling into the sea.  Now the terrace was empty of people. Ming went left, back into the bedroom, and was at once aware of the man’s presence, though there was no light on and Ming could not see him. The man was standing by the dressing-table, opening a box. Again involuntarily Ming gave a low growl which rose and fell, and Ming remained frozen in the position he had been in when he first became aware of the man, his right front paw extended for the next step. Now his ears were back, he was prepared to spring in any  direction, although the man had not seen him. ‘Ssss-st! Damn you!’ the man said in a whisper. He stamped his foot, not very hard,  to make the cat go away.  Ming did not move at all. Ming heard the soft rattle of the white necklace which belonged to his mistress. The man put it into his pocket, then moved to Ming’s right, out the door that went into the big living-room. Ming now heard the clink of a bottle against glass, heard liquid being poured. Ming went through the same door and turned left  toward the kitchen. Here he miaowed, and was greeted by Elaine and Concha. Concha had her radio  turned on to music. ‘Fish? — Pork. He likes pork,’ Elaine said, speaking the odd form of words which she  used with Concha.  Ming, without much difﬁculty, conveyed his preference for pork, and got it. He fell to with a good appetite. Concha was exclaiming ‘Ah—eeeee!’ as his mistress spoke With her, spoke at length. Then Concha bent to stroke him, and Ming put up with it, still looking down at his plate, until she left off and he could finish his meal. Then Elaiﬂe left the kitchen. Concha gave him some of the tinned milk, which he loved, in his HOW it it it                              Ming’s Biggest Prey 283  empty saucer, and Ming lapped this up. Then he rubbed himself against her bare leg by way of thanks, and went out of the kitchen, made his way cautiously into the living-room en route to the bedroom. But now his mistress and the man were out on the terrace. Ming had just entered the bedroom, when he heard Elaine call:  ‘Ming? Where are you?’  Ming went to the terrace door and stopped, and sat on the threshold.  Elaine was sitting sideways at the end of the table, and the candlelight was bright on her long fair hair, on the white of her trousers. She slapped her thigh, and Ming jumped onto her lap.  The man said something in a low tone, something not nice.  Elaine replied something in the same tone. But she laughed a little.  Then the telephone rang.  Elaine put Ming down, and went into the living—room toward the telephone.  The man finished what was in his glass, muttered something at Ming, then set the glass on the table. He got up and tried to circle Ming, or to get him toward the edge of the terrace, Ming realised, and Ming also realised that the man was drunk — therefore moving slowly and a little clumsily. The terrace had a parapet about as high as the man’s hips, but it was broken by grilles in three places, grilles with bars wide enough for Ming to pass through, though Ming never did, merely looked through the grilles sometimes. It was plain to Ming that the man wanted to drive him through one of the grilles, or grab him and toss him over the terrace parapet. There Was nothing easier for Ming than to elude him. Then the man picked up a chair and swung it suddenly, catching Ming on the hip. That had been quick, and it hurt. Ming took the nearest exit, which was down the outside steps that led to the garden.  The man started down the steps after him. Without reﬂecting, Ming dashed back up the few steps he had come, keeping close to the wall which was in shadow. The man hadn’t seen him, Ming knew. Ming leapt to the terrace parapet, sat down and licked a paw once to recover and collect himself. His heart beat fast as if he were in the middle of a fight. And hatred ran in his veins. Hatred burned his eyes as he crouched and listened to the man uncertainly climbing the steps below him. The man came into view.  Ming tensed himself for a jump, then jumped as hard as he could, landing with all four feet on the man’s right arm near the shoulder. Ming clung to the cloth of the man’s white jacket, but they were both falling. The man groaned. Ming hung on. Branches crackled. Ming could not tell up from down. Ming jumped off the man, became aware of direction and of the earth too late and landed on his side. Almost at the same time, he heard the thud of the man hitting the ground, then of his body rolling a little way, then there was silence. Ming had to breathe fast with his mouth open until his Chest stopped hurting. From the direction of the man, he could smell drink, cigar, and the Sharp odour that meant fear. But the man was not moving.  Ming could now see quite well. There was even a bit of moonlight. Ming headed for the steps again, had to go a long way through the bush, over stones and sand, to where the Steps began. Then he glided up and arrived once more upon the terrace.  Elaine was just coming onto the terrace. 284 Stories of Ourselves  ‘Teddie?’ she called. Then she went back into the bedroom where she turned on a lamp. She went into the kitchen. Ming followed her. Concha had left the light on, but Concha was now in her own room, where the radio played.  Elaine opened the front door.  The man’s car was still in the driveway, Ming saw. Now Ming’s hip had begun to hurt, or now he had begun to notice it. It caused him to limp a little. Elaine noticed this, touched his back, and asked him what was the matter. Ming only purred.  ‘Teddie? — Where are you?’ Elaine called.  She took a torch and shone it down into the garden, down among the great trunks of the avocado trees, among the orchids and the lavender and pink blossoms of the bougainvilleas. Ming, safe beside her on the terrace parapet, followed the beam of the torch with his eyes and purred with content. The man was not below here, but below and to the right. Elaine went to the terrace steps and carefully, because there was no rail here, only broad steps, pointed the beam of the light downward. Ming did not bother looking. He sat on the terrace where the steps began.  ‘Teddie!’ she said. ‘Teddie!’ Then she ran down the steps.  Ming still did not follow her. He heard her draw in her breath. Then she cried:  ‘Concha!’  Elaine ran back up the steps. Concha had come out of her room. Elaine spoke to Concha. Then Concha became  excited. Elaine went to the telephone, and spoke for a short while, then she and Concha went down the steps together. Ming settled himself with his paws tucked under him on the terrace, which was still faintly warm from the day’s sun. A car arrived. Elaine came up the steps, and went and opened the front door. Ming kept out of the way on the terrace, in a shadowy corner, as three or four strange men came out on the terrace and tramped down the steps. There was a great deal of talk belOw, noises of feet, breaking of bushes, and then the smell of all of them mounted the steps, the smell of tobacco, sweat, and the familiar smell of blood. The man’s blood. Ming was pleased, as he was pleased when he killed a bird and created this smell of blood under his own teeth. This was big prey. Ming, unnoticed by any of the others, stood up to his full height as the group passed with the corpse, and inhaled the aroma of his victory with a lifted nose.  Then suddenly the house was empty. Everyone had gone, even Concha. Ming drank a little water from his bowl in the kitchen, then went to his mistress’ bed, curled against the slope of the pillows, and fell fast asleep. He was awakened by the rr-rr-r of an unfamiliar car. Then the front door opened, and he recognised the step of Elaine and then Concha. Ming stayed where he was. Elaine and Concha talked softly for a few minutes. Then Elaine came into the bedroom. The lamp was still on. Ming watched her slowly open the box on her dressing—table, and into it she let fall the white necklace that made a little clatter. Then she closed the box. She began to unbutton her shirt, but before she had ﬁnished, she ﬂung herself on the bed and stroked Ming’s head, lifted his left paw and pressed it gently so that the claws came forth.  ‘Oh Ming — Ming,’ she said.  Ming recognised the tones of love.
