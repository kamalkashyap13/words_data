Exercise 1: The Gardener

Read the passage and answer the writer’s craft questions which follow.

There is a look of desperation about him
nowadays as he works, digging and hoeing
furiously - sometimes bringing out great
clumps ofshrubs and flowers along with the
weeds — the sweat running down his back.

He does not enjoy the exercise. i see his face as
he works, features crunching with the effort.

He seems to hate the soil he digs, to hate the
plants with which he struggles. He looks like a
miser forced to shovel banknotes into a furnace:
hunger, disgust and reluctant fascination

And yet he never gives up. Watching him i feel a
familiar pang offear, though for what I am not
sure. He is like a machine this man, my enemy.

Read the passage and answer the writer’s craft questions which follow.

‘Well. if it’s no trouble  ’Her manner was different today. There was a kind ofcrispness in
her voice, a studied casualness which masked a high level of tension. She was wearing a
black straw hat trimmed with a ribbon and a coat - also black—which looked new.

‘You’re very chic today,’ I observed.

She gave a sharp crack of laughter. ‘No—one’s said that to me for a while, i’ll tell you,’ she said.

Exercise 4: Cell Phones

For many people, cell phones are a lifeline, a connection to family and friends,
a way of keeping in touch with the work place in a fast moving world where
we never seem to have enough time to complete all thejobs we have

planned. They provide an oasis of calm into which we can step trom
the desert of modern living.

But for others, cell phones are the scourge of modern society.
You only have to watch people who are, supposedly, on an
afternoon in each other’s company. What are they doing?

Exercise 5: Nizam and Hemu

it was easy to see that Nizam and Hemu were excellent English teachers. Their students were
clay in their hands, as they moulded them through gentle correction oitheir grammatical

errors and the praising of their achievements. They loved English literature and lit a flame in
many of their students which would never be extinguished.

When the bell rang to signal the end ofone lesson and the beginning ofthe next, their students
ﬂew down the corridor to their classrooms. They were obviously passionate about teaching

and this showed in the excellent results they achieved and the high regard in which they were
clearly held by the Principal ofthe school as well as by their students.30 More exercises in annreeiating writers’ eraﬂ

Exercise 6: Calling the Doctor

Afterl had made up my mind to see the doctor, l consulted my friend Lydia, who suggested
that i should ring up the doctor and ask him to come and see me at home, instead of going to
him; l immediately thought how nice it would be ifonly l dare, ‘Ot course you dare,’ said Lydia.
‘You can’t take a sick baby out in weather like this? Then, with sudden illumination, she said,
‘Anyway, look how flushed she is! Why don’t you take her temperature?’

Astounded, l stared at her, for truly the thought ofdoing such a thing had never crossed

my mind. Looking back, after months with the thermometer as necessary as a spoon or a
saucepan, i can hardly believe this to be possible, but so it was; my life had not yet changed for
ever. l took Octavia’s temperature and it was high enough tojustify ringing for the doctor. To
my surprise, the doctor’s secretary did not sound at all annoyed when i asked if he could call: i
think 1 had half expected a lecture.

When the doctor arrived, he took Octavia’s pulse and temperature, and told me it was nothing
serious, in fact nothing at all. Then he said he ought to listen to her chest; I pulled up her vest
and she smiled and wriggled with delight as he put the stethoscope on her fat ribs. He listened
for a long time and l, who was beginning to think that perhaps l should not have bothered him
after all, sat there absently aware of how innocent she was, how sweet she looked and that her
vest could do with a wash. Had I known, l would have enjoyed that moment more, or perhaps

I mean that i did enjoy that moment but have enjoyed none since. For he said, ‘Well, i don’t
think there’s anything very much to worry about there.’ i could see that he had not finished,
and did not mean what he said. ‘Just the same,’ he added, ‘perhaps l ought to book you an
appointment to take her along to the hospital.’

i suppose most people would have asked him what was wrong. i think that the truth was the
last thing i wanted to hear. When i heard his voice coming at me, saying that the hospital
appointment would probably be for the next Thursday, l was relieved a little; he could not be
expecting her to die betore next Thursday, 1 even mustered the strength to ask what i should do
about her cold, and he said, ‘Nothing, nothing at all.’
