Once upon an ordinary school day, an ordinary boy woke from his ordinary dreams, got out of his ordinary dreams, put on his ordinary clothes and ate his ordinary breakfast.
The ordinary boy brushed ordinary teeth, kissed his ordinary mum goodbye and set off for his ordianry school.

The ordinary boy went into his ordinary classroom and sat at his ordinary desk. Then, something quite out of the ordinary happened ...
 “Good morning, everybody!” said a quite extraordinary ﬁgure, bounding into the classroom. "My name is Mr Gee and I’m your new teacher. Now, you don’t know me and I don’t know you, so, to help me to get to know you, I’ve had an idea ...”
As Mr Gee handed out paper, he said, “For our ﬁrst lesson together I want you to listen to some music and I want you to let the music make pictures in your heads. Is that clear?" And the ordinary children whispered: “He’s barmy!” “He’s bonkers!" “He’s asnutty as a fruitcake!” “Music?” “Pictures?” “What's he on about?"
And Mr Gee said, “Shush, just close your eyes, open your ears and listen. ”And the music began: a rumbling, rolling, thunderous music that boomed and crashed around the classroom. Suddenly it stopped. And Mr Gee said: “Tell me what the music made you think of. ”One girl shouted, “Stampeding horses!” Someone else said, “No, it was racing cars!” And the ordinary boy said, "I saw elephants, Sir, and there were hundreds of them!” “Yes,” laughed Mr Gee. “Isn’t it wonderful? Now, I want all of you to try to put Whatyou hear on paper. Start writing!” And as the music grew and swooped and danced and dived once more, the ordinary boy began to write.


Grace was a girl who loved stories. She didn’t mind if they were read to her or told to her or made up out of her own head. She didn’t care if they were from books or on TV or in ﬁlms or on the video or out of Nana’s long memory. Grace just loved stories. And after she had heard them, or sometimes While they were still going on, Grace would act them out. And she always gave herself the most exciting part.
One day at school her teacher said they were going to do the play of Peter Pan. Grace put up her hand to be Peter Pan. "You can’t be called Peter,” said Raj. “That’s a boy’s name.” But Grace kept her hand up. “You can’t be Peter Pan," whispered Natalie. "He wasn’t black." But Grace kept her hand up. “All right,” said the teacher. “Lots of you want to be Peter Pan, so we’ll have to have auditions. We’ll choose the parts next Monday.”

When Grace got home, she seemed rather sad. “What’s the matter?” asked Ma. “Raj said I couldn’t be Peter Pan because I’m a girl.” “That just shows all Raj knows about it,” said Ma. “Peter Pan is always a girl!” Grace cheered up, then later she remembered something else. “ Natalie says I can’t be Peter Pan because I’m black," she said. Ma started to get angry but Nana stopped her.
"It seems that Natalie is another one who don't know nothing," she said. "You can be anything you want, Grace if you put your mind to it."
