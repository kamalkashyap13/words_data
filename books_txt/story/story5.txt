My father took on that farm not long after he came back from the first war. It was pretty well the last farm up the river. Behind our farm, and up the river, there was all kind of wild country. Scrub and jagged black humps on the hills, bush in gullies where fire hadn’t reached; hills and more hills, deep valleys with caves and twisting rivers, and mountains white with winter in the distance. We had the last piece of really ﬂat land on the river. It wasn’t the first farm my father’d taken on — and it certainly wasn’t to be the last — but it was the most remote. He always said that was why he’d got the place for a song. This puzzled me as a child. For I’d heard, of course, of having to sing for your supper. I wondered what words, to what tune, he was obliged to sing for the farm; and where, and why? Had he travelled up the river, singing a strange song, charming his way into possession of the land? It always perplexed me.  And it perplexed me because there wasn’t much room for singing in my father’s life. I can’t remember ever having heard him sing. There was room for plodding his paddocks in all weathers, milking cows and sending cream down river to the dairy factory, and cursing the bloody Government; there was room in his life for all these things and more, but not for singing.  In time, of course, I understood that he only meant he’d bought the place cheaply. Cheaply meant for a song. I couldn’t, even then, quite make the connexion. It remained for a long while one of those adult mysteries. And it was no use puzzling over it, no use asking my father for a more coherent explanation.  ‘Don’t be difficult,’ he’d say. ‘Don’t ask so many damn questions. Life’s difficult enough, boy, without all your damn questions.’  He didn’t mean to be unkind; it was just his way. His life was committed to winning order from wilderness. Questions were a disorderly intrusion, like gorse or Weed springing up on good pasture. The best way was to hack them down, grub out the roots, before they could spread. And in the same way as he checked incipient anarchy on his land he hoped, perhaps, to check it in his son. The People Before 199  By that time I was old enough to understand a good many of the things that were to be understood. One of them, for example, was that we weren’t the first people on that particular stretch of land. Thirty or forty years before, when white men first came into our part of the country, it was mostly forest. Those ﬁrst people ﬁred the forest, right back into the hills, and ran sheep. The sheep grazed not only the ﬂat, but the hills which rose sharply behind our farm; the hills which, in our time, had become stubbly with manuka and fern. The flatland had been pretty much scrub too, the day my father first saw it; and the original people had been gone twenty years — they’d given up, or been ruined by the land; we never quite knew the story. The farmhouse stood derelict among the returning wilderness.  Well, my father saw right away that the land — the ﬂat land — was a reasonable proposition for a dairy farm. There was a new launch service down to the nearest dairy factory, in the township ten miles away; only in the event of flood, or a launch breakdown, would he have to dispose of his cream by carrying it on a sledge across country, three miles, to the nearest road. ,  So he moved in, cleared the scrub, sowed new grass, and brought in cows. Strictly speaking, the hills at the back of the farm were his too, but he had no use for them. They made good shelter from the westerlies. Otherwise he never gave the hills a thought, since he had all the land he could safely manage; he roamed across them after wild pig, and that was about all. There werebones up there, scattered skeletons of lost sheep, in and about the scrub and burnt stumps.  Everything went well; he had the place almost paid off by the time of the depression. ‘I never looked back, those years,’ he said long afterwards. It was characteristic of him not to look back. He was not interested in who had the farm before him. He had never troubled to inquire. So far as he was concerned, history only began the day he first set foot on the land. It was his, by sweat and legal title: that was all that mattered. That was all that could matter.  He had two boys; I was the elder son. ‘You and Jim will take this place over one day,’ he often told me. ‘You’ll run it when I get tired.’  But he didn’t look like getting tired. He wasn’t a big man, but he was wiry and thin with a lean face and cool blue eyes; he was one of those people who can’t keep still. When neighbours called he couldn’t ever keep comfortable in a chair, just sitting and sipping tea, but had to start walking them round the farm — or at least the male neighbours — pointing out things here and there. Usually work he’d done, improvements he’d made: the new milking-shed, the new water—pump on the river. He didn’t strut or boast, though; he just pointed them out quietly, these jobs well done. He wanted others to Share his satisfaction. There was talk of electricity coming through to the farm, the telephone; a road up the river was scheduled. It would all put the value of the property up. The risk he’d taken on the remote and abandoned land seemed justified in every way.  He didn’t ever look like getting tired. It was as if he’d been wound up years before, like something clockwork, and set going: ﬁrst fighting in the war, then ﬁghting with the land; now most of the fighting was done, he sometimes found it quite an effort to keep 200 Stories of Ourselves  busy. He never took a holiday. There was talk of taking a holiday, one winter when the cows dried off; talk of us all going down to the sea, and leaving a neighbour to look after the place. But I don’t think he could have trusted anyone to look after his land, not even for a week or two in winter when the cows were dried off. Perhaps, when Jim and I were grown, it would be different. But not until? He always found some reason for us not to get away. Like our schooling.  ‘1 don’t want to interfere with their schooling,’ he said once. ‘They only get it once in their lives. And they might as well get it while they can. I didn’t get much. And, by God, I regret it now. I don’t know much, and I might have got along all right, but I might have got along a damn sight better if I’d had more schooling. And I’m not going to interfere with theirs by carting them off for a holiday in the middle of the year.’  Yet even then I wondered if he meant a word of it, if he really wasn’t just saying that for something to say. He was wrangling at the time with my mother, who held opinions on a dwindling number of subjects. She never surrendered any of these opinions, exactly; she just kept them more and more to herself until, presumably, they lapsed quietly and died. As she herself, much later, was to lapse quietly from life, without much complaint.  For if he’d really been concerned about our schooling, he might have been more concerned about the way we fell asleep in afternoon classes. Not that we were the only ones. Others started getting pretty ragged in the afternoons too. A lot of us had been up helping our fathers since early in the morning. Jim and I were up at half—past four most mornings to help with the milking and working the separators. My father increased his herd year after year, right up to the depression. After school we rode home just in time for the evening milking. And by the time we ﬁnished it was getting dark; in winter it was dark by the time we were half-way through the herd.  I sometimes worried about Jim looking worn in the evenings, and I often chased him off inside before milking was finished. I thought Jim needed looking after; he wasn’t anywhere near as big as me. I’d hear him scamper off to the house, and then I’d set about stripping the cows he had left. Father sometimes complained.  ‘You’ll make that brother of yours a softy,’ he said. ‘The boy’s got to learn what work means.’  ‘Jim’s all right,’ I answered. ‘He’s not a softy. He’s just not very big. That’s all.’  He detested softies, even the accomplices of softies. My mother, in a way, was such an accomplice. She’d never been keen about first me, then Jim, helping with work on the farm. But my father said he couldn’t afford to hire a man to help with the herd. And he certainly couldn’t manage by himself, without Jim and me.  ‘Besides,’ he said, ‘my Dad and me used to milk two hundred cows’ — sometimes, when he became heated, the number rose to three hundred — ‘when I was eight years old. And thin as a rake too, I was. Eight years old and thin as a rake. It didn’t do me no harm. You boys don’t know what work is, let me tell you.’  So there all argument finished. My mother kept one more opinion to herself.  And I suppose that, when I chased Jim off inside, I was only taking my mother ’5 side in the argument — and was only another accomplice of softies. Anyway, it WO111d give me a good feeling afterwards — despite anything my father would have to Say ’ The People Before 201  when we tramped back to the house, through the night smelling of frost or rain, to find Jim sitting up at the table beside my mother while she ladled out soup under the warm yellow lamplight. He looked as if he belonged there, beside her; and she always looked, at those times, a little triumphant. Her look seemed to say that one child of hers, at least, was going to be saved from the muck of the cowshed. And I suppose that was the beginning of how Jim became his mother’s boy.  I remained my father’s. I wouldn’t have exchanged him for another father. I liked seeing him with people, a man among men. This happened on winter Saturdays when we rode to the township for the football. We usually left Jim behind to look after my mother. We tethered our horses near the football field and went off to join the crowd. Football was one of the few things which interested my father outside the farm, He’d been a fine rugby forward in his day and people respected what he had to say about the game. He could out-argue most people; probably out—ﬁght them too, if it ever came to that. He often talked about the fights he’d had when young. For he’d done a bit of boxing too, only he couldn’t spare the time from his father’s farm to train properly. He knocked me down once, with his bare fists, in the cowshed; and I was careful never to let it happen again. I just kept my head down for days afterwards, so that he wouldn’t see the bruises on my face or the swelling round my eye.  At the football he barracked with the best of them in the thick of the crowd. Sometimes he called out when the rest of the crowd was silent and tense; he could be very sarcastic about poor players, softies who were afraid to tackle properly.  After the game he often called in, on the way home, to have a few beers with friends in the township’s sly-grog shop — we didn’t have a proper pub in the township — while I looked after the horses outside. Usually he’d find time, while he gossiped with friends, to bring me out a glass of lemonade. At times it could be very cold out there, holding the horses while the winter wind swept round, but it would be nice to know that I was remembered. When he finished we rode home together for a late milking. He would grow talkative, as we cantered towards dark, and even give me the impression he was glad of my company. He told me about the time he was young, what the world looked like when he was my age. His father was a sharemilker, travelling from place to place; that is, he owned no land of his own and did other people’s work.  ‘So I made up my mind, boy,’ he told me as we rode along together, ‘I made up my mind I’d never be like that. I’d bend my head to no man. And you know what the secret of that is, boy? Land. Land of your own. You’re independent, boy. You can say no to the world. That’s if you got your own little kingdom. I reckon it was what kept me alive, down there on the beach at Gallipoli, knowng I’d have some land I could call my Own.’ This final declaration seemed to dismay him for some reason or other, perhaps because he feared he’d given too much of himself away. So he added half-apologetically, ’I had to think of something, you know, while all that shooting was going on. They say it’s best to fix your mind on something if you don’t want to be afraid. That’s what I fixed my mind on, anyhow. Maybe it did keep me alive.’  In late winter or 'spring we sometimes arrived back, on Saturdays, to see the last trembling light of sunset fade from the hills and land. We’d canter along a straight Stretch, coast up a rise, rein in the horses, and there it was — his green kingdom, his 202 Stories of Ourselves  tight tamed acres beneath the hills and beside the river, a thick spread of fenced grass  from the dark fringe of hillscrub down to the ragged willows above the water. And at the centre was his castle, the farmhouse, with the sheds scattered round, and the pine trees.  Reining in on that rise, I knew, gave him a good feeling. It would also be the time when he remembered all the jobs he’d neglected, all the work he should have done instead of going to the football. His conscience would keep him busy all day Sunday.  At times he wondered — it was a conversation out loud with himself — why he didn’t sell up and buy another place. There were, after all, more comfortable farms, in more convenient locations nearer towns or cities. ‘I’ve built this place up from nothing,’ he said, ‘I’ve made it pay, and pay well. I’ve made this land worth something. I could sell out for a packet. Why don’t I?’  He never really — in my presence anyway — offered himself a convincing ex- planation. Why didn’t he? He’d hardly have said he loved the land: love, in any case, would have been an extravagance. Part of whatever it was, I suppose, was the knowledge that he’d built where someone else had failed; part was that he’d given too much of himself there, to be really free anywhere else. It wouldn’t be the same, walking on to another successful farm, a going concern, everything in order. No, this place — this land from the river back up to the hills — was his. In a sense it had only  ever been his. That was why he felt so secure.  If Sunday was often the day when he worked hardest, it was also the best day for Jim and me, our free day. After morning milking, and breakfast, we did more or less what we liked. In summer we swam down under the river-willows; we also had a canoe tied there and sometimes we paddled up-river, under great limestone bluffs shaggy with toi toi, into country which grew wilder and wilder. There were huge bearded caves in the bush above the water which we explored from time to time. There were also big eels to be fished from the pools of the river.  As he grew older Jim turned more into himself, and became still quieter. You could never guess exactly what he was thinking. It wasn’t that he didn’t enjoy life; he just had his own way of enjoying it. He didn’t like being with his father, as I did; I don’t even know that he always enjoyed being with me. He just tagged along with me: we were, after all, brothers. When I was old enough, my father presented me with a .22 riﬂe; Jim never showed great enthusiasm for shooting. He came along with me, all right, but he never seemed interested in the rabbits or wild goat I shot, or just missed. H6 wandered around the hills, way behind me, entertainng himself and collecting things. He gathered leaves, and tried to identify the plants from which the leaves came. He also collected stones, those of some interesting shape or texture; he had a big collection of stones. He tramped along, in his slow, quiet way, poking into everything, adding to hiS collections. He wasn’t too slow and quiet at school, though; he was faster than most 0f us with an answer. He borrowed books from the teacher, and took them home. SO in time he became even smarter with his answers. I grew to accept his difference from most people. It didn’t disturb me particularly: on the farm he was still quiet, small Jim. He was never too busy with his books to come along with me on Sundays.  >l< The People Before 203  There was a night when Jim was going through some new stones he’d gathered. Usually, in the house, my father didn’t take much notice of Jim, his reading or his hobbies. He’d fought a losing battle for Jim, through the years, and now accepted his defeat. Jim still helped us with the herd, night and morning, but in the house he was ignored. But this night my father went across to the table and picked up a couple of the new stones. They were greenish, both the same triangular shape.  ‘Where’d you get these?’ he asked.  Jim thought for a moment; he seemed pleased by the interest taken in him. ‘One was back in the hills,’ he said. ‘The other was in a cave up the river. I just picked them up,’  ‘You mean you didn’t find them together?’  ‘No,’ Jim said.  ‘Funny,’ my father said. ‘They look like greenstone. I seen some greenstone once. A joker found it, picked it up in the bush. Jade, it is; same thing. This joker sold it in the city for a packet. Maori stuff. Some people’ll buy anything.’  We all crossed to the table and looked down at the greenish stone. Jim’s eyes were bright with excitment. ’  ‘You mean these used to belong to the Maoris?’ he said. ‘These stones?’  ‘Must have,’ my father said. ‘Greenstone doesn’t come natural round here. You look it up in your books and you’ll see. Comes from way down south, near the mountains and glaciers. Had to come up here all the‘way by canoe. They used to fight about greenstone once.’ He paused and looked at the stones again. ‘Yes,’ he added. ‘I reckon that’s greenstone, all right. You never know, might be some money in that stuff.’  Money was a very important subject in our house at that time. It was in a lot of households, since that time was the depression. In the cities they were marching in the streets and breaking shop windows. Here on the farm it wasn’t anywhere near so dramatic. The grass looked much the same as it had always looked; so did the hills and river. All that had happened, really, was that the farm had lost its value. Prices had fallen; my. father sometimes wondered if it was worth while sending cream to the factory. Some of the people on poorer land, down the river, had walked off their properties. Everything was tighter. We had to do without new clothes, and there wasn’t much variety in our eating. We ran a bigger garden, and my father went out more frequently shooting wild pig for meat. He had nothing but contempt for the noisy people in the city, the idlers and wasters who preferred to go shouting in the streets rather than fetch a square meal for their families, as he did with his riﬂe. He thought they, in some way, were to blame for the failure of things. Even so, he became gripped by the idea that he might have failed himself, somehow; he tried to talk himself out of this idea — in my presence — but without much success. Now he had the land solid beneath his feet, owned it entirely, it wasn’t much help at all. If it wasn’t for our garden and the Wild pig we might starve. The land didn’t bring him any money; he might even have to leave it. He had failed, perhaps much as the land’s former owners had failed; why? He might have answered the question for himself satisfactorily, while he grubbed away at the scrub encroaching on our pasture; but I doubt it.  ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘Might be some money in that stuff.’ P—u——————i        204 Stories of Ourselves  But Jim didn’t seem to hear, or understand. His eyes were still bright. ‘That means there must have been Maoris here in the old days,’ he said.  ‘I suppose there must have,’ my father agreed. He didn’t seem much interested. Maoris were Maoris. There weren’t many around our part of the river; they were mostly down towards the coast. (Shortly after this, Jim did some research and told me the reason why. It turned out that the land about our part of the river had been confiscated from them after the Maori wars.) ‘They were most places, weren’t they?’ he added.  ‘Yes,’ Jim said. ‘But I mean they must have been here. On our place.’  ‘Well, yes. They could of been. Like I said, they were most places.’  It didn’t seem to register as particularly important. He picked up the greenstone again. ‘We ought to find out about this,’ he continued. ‘There might be a bit of money in 1t.’  Later Jim took the stones to school and had them identified as Maori adzes. My father said once again that perhaps there was money in them. But the thing was, where to find a buyer? It mightn’t be as easy as it used to be. So somehow it was all forgotten. Jim kept the adzes.  Jim and I did try to find again that cave in which he had picked up an adze. We found a lot of caves, but none of them seemed the right one. Anyway we didn’t pick up another adze. We did wander down one long dripping cave, striking matches, and in the dark I tripped on something. I struck another match and saw some brownish—looking bones. ‘A sheep,’ I said. ‘It must have come in here and got lost.’  Jim was silent; I wondered why. Then I saw he wasn’t looking at the bones, but at a human skull propped on a ledge of the cave. It just sat there sightless, shadows dancing in its sockets. .  We got out of that cave quickly. We didn’t even talk about it when we reached home. On the whole I preferred going out with my .22 after rabbits.  II  It was near the end of the depression. But we didn’t know that then, of course. It might have been just the beginning, for all we knew. My father didn’t have as much interest in finishing jobs as he used to have. He tired easily. He’d given his best to the land, and yet his best still wasn’t good enough. There wasn’t much sense in anything and his dash was done. He kept going out of habit.  I’d been pulled out of school to help with the farm. Jim still more or less went to school. I say more or less because he went irregularly. This was because of sickness. Once he was away in hospital two months. And of course it cost money; my father said we were to blame, we who allowed Jim to become soft and sickly. But the doctor thought otherwise; he thought Jim had been worked hard enough already. And when Jim returned to the farm he no longer helped with the herd. And this was why I had to leave school: if he couldn’t have both of us working with him part—time, my father wanted one full-time. Jim was entirely surrendered at last, to the house and books, to school and my mother. I didn’t mind working on the farm all day, with my father; it was, after all, what I’d always wanted. All the same, I would have been happier if he had  a; .5 The People Before 205  been: his doubts about himself, more and more frequently expressed, disturbed me. It wasn’t like my father at all. He was convinced now he’d done the wrong thing, somewhere. He went back through the years, levering each year up like a stone, to see what lay beneath; he never seemed to find anything. It was worst of all in winter, when the land looked bleak, the hills were grey with low cloud, and the rain swirled out of the sky. All life vanished from his face and I knew he detested everything: the land which had promised him independence was now only a muddy snare; he was bogged here, between hills and river, and couldn’t escape. He had no pride left in him for the place. If he could have got a price for the farm he would have gone. But there was no longer any question of a price. He could walk off if he liked. Only the bush would Claim it back.  It was my mother who told us there were people coming. She had taken the telephone message while we were out of the house, and Jim was at the school.  ‘Who are they?’ my father said.  ‘I couldn’t understand very well. It was a bad connexion. I think they said they were the people who were here before.’  ‘The people who were here before? What the hell do they want here?’ His eyes became suspicious under his frown.  ‘I think they said they just wanted to have a look around.’  ‘What the hell do they want here?’ my father repeated, bafﬂed. ‘Nothing for them to see. This farm’s not like it was when they were here. Everything’s different. I’ve made a lot of changes. They wouldn’t know the place. What do they want to come back for?’  ‘Well,’ my mother sighed, ‘I’m sure I don’t know.’  ‘Perhaps they want to buy it,’ he said abruptly; the words seemed simultaneous with his thought, and he stiffened with astonishment. ‘By God, yes. They might want to buy the place back again. I hadn’t thought of that. Wouldn’t that be a joke? I’d sell, all right — for just about as much as I paid for the place. I tell you, I’d let it go for a song, for a bloody song. They’re welcome.’  ‘But where would we go?’ she said, alarmed.  ‘Somewhere,’ he said. ‘Somewhere new. Anywhere.’  ‘But there’s nowhere,’ she protested. ‘Nowhere any better. You know that.’  ‘And there’s nowhere any worse,’ he answered. ‘I’d start again somewhere. Make a better go of things.’  ‘You’re too old to start again,’ my mother observed softly.  There was a silence. And in the silence I knew that what my mother said was true. We all knew it was true.  ‘So we just stay here,’ he said. ‘And rot. Is that it?’ But he really wished to change the subject. ‘When are these people coming?’  ‘Tomorrow, I think. They’re staying the night down in the township. Then they’re Coming up by launch.’  ‘They didn’t say why they were interested in the place?’ 206 Stories of Ourselves  ‘No. And they certainly didn’t say they wanted to buy it. You might as well get that straight now. They said they just wanted a look around.’  ‘I don’t get it. I just don’t get it. If I walked off this place I wouldn’t ever want to see it again.’  ‘Perhaps they’re different,’ my mother said. “Perhaps they’ve got happy memories of this place.’  ‘Perhaps they have. God knows.’  It was early summer, with warm lengthening days. That sunny Saturday morning I loitered about the house with Jim, waiting for the people to arrive. Eventually, as the sun climbed higher in the sky, I grew impatient and went across the paddocks to help my father. We were working together when we heard the sound of the launch coming up the river.  ‘That’s them,’ he said brieﬂy. He dropped his slasher for a moment, and spat on his hands. Then he took up the slasher again and chopped into a new patch of unruly gorse.  I was perplexed. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘aren’t you going down to meet them?’  ‘I’ll see them soon enough. Don’t worry.’ He seemed to be conducting an argument with himself as he hacked into the gorse. ‘I’m in no hurry. No, I’m in no hurry to see them.’  I just kept silent beside him.  ‘Who are they, anyway?’ he went on. ‘What do they want to come traipsing round my property for? They’ve got a bloody cheek.’  The sound of the launch grew. It was probably travelling round the last bend in the river now, past the swamp of raupo, and banks prickly with ﬂax and toi toi. They were almost at the farm. Still chopping jerkily, my father tried to conceal his unease.  ‘What do they want?’ he asked for the last time. ‘By God, if they’ve come to gloat, they’ve got another thing coming. I’ve made something decent out of this place, and I don’t care who knows it.’  He had tried everything in his mind and it was no use: he was empty of explanation. Now we could see the launch white on the gleaming river. It was coasting up to the bank. We could also see people clustered on board.  ‘Looks like a few of them,’ I observed. If I could have done so without upsetting my father, I would have run down to meet the launch, eager with curiosity. But I kept my distance until he ﬁnished arguing with himself.  ‘Well,’ he said, as if he’d never suggested otherwise, ‘we’d better go down to meet them, now they’re here.’ He dug his slasher into the earth and began to stalk off down to the river. I followed him. His quick strides soon took him well ahead of me; I had to run to keep up.  Then we had our surprise. My father’s step faltered; I blundered up alongside him. We saw the people climbing off the launch. And we saw who they were, at last. My father stopped perfectly still and silent. They were Maoris. We were still a hundred yards or  more away, but there was no mistaking their clothing and colour. They were Maoris, all right. a i l i l        The People Before 207  ‘There’s something wrong somewhere,” he said at last. ‘It doesn’t make sense, N0 Maori ever owned this place. I’d have known. Who the hell do they think they are, coming here?’  I couldn’t answer him. He strode on down to the river. There were young men, and two old women with black head—scarves. And last of all there was something the young men carried. As we drew nearer we saw it was an old man in a rough litter. The whole party of them fussed over making the old man comfortable. The old women, particularly; they had tattoos on their chins and wore sharktooth necklaces. They straightened the old man’s blankets and fixed the pillow behind his head. He had a sunken, withered face and he didn’t look so much sick, as tired. His eyes were only half—open as everyone fussed around. It looked as if it were a great effort to keep them that much open. His hair was mostly grey, and his dry ﬂesh sagged in thin folds about his ancient neck. I reckoned that he must have been near enough to a hundred years old. The young men talked quickly among themselves as they saw my father approaching. One came forward, apparently as spokesman. He looked about the oldest of them, perhaps thirty. He had a fat, shiny face.  ‘Here,’ said my father. ‘What’s all this about?’ I knew his opinion of Maoris: they were lazy, drank too much, and caused trouble. They just rode on the backs of the men on the land, like the loafers in the cities. He always said we were lucky there were so few in our district. ‘What do you people think you’re doing here?’ he demanded.  ‘We rang up yesterday,’ the spokesman said. ‘We told your missus we might be coming today.’  ‘I don’t know about that. She said someone else was coming. The people who were here before.’  ‘Well,’ said the young man, smiling. ‘We were the people before.’  ‘I don’t get you. You trying to tell me you owned this place?’  ‘That’s right. We owned all the land round this end of the river. Our tribe.’  ‘That must have been a hell of a long time ago.’  ‘Yes,’ agreed the stranger. ‘A long time.’ He was pleasantly spoken and patient. His round face, which I could imagine looking jolly, was very solemn just then.  I looked around and saw my mother and Jim coming slowly down from the house.  ‘I still don’t get it,’ my father said. ‘What do you want?’  ‘We just want to go across your land, if that’s all right. Look, we better introduce ourselves. My name is Tom Taikaka. And this—’  My father was lost in a confusion of introductions. But he still didn’t shake anyone’s hand. He just stood his ground, aloof and faintly hostile. Finally there was the old man. He looked as though he had gone to sleep again.  ‘You see he’s old,’ Tom explained. ‘And has not so long to live. He is the last great man of our tribe, the oldest. He wishes to see again where he was born. The land over Which his father was chief. He wishes to see this before his spirit departs for Rerengawairua.’  By this time my mother and Jim had joined us. They were as confused as we were.  ‘You mean you’ve come just to—’ my father began. r_____i     208 Stories of Ourselves  ‘We’ve come a long way,’ Tom said. ‘Nearly a hundred miles, from up the coast. That’s where we live now.’  ‘All this way. Just so—’  ‘Yes,’ Tom said. ‘That’s right.’  ‘Well,’ said my father. ‘What do you know? What do you know about that?’ Bafﬂed, he looked at me, at my mother, and even finally at Jim. None of us had anything to say.  ‘I hope we’re not troubling you,’ Tom said politely. ‘We don’t want to be any trouble. We just want to go across your land, if that’s all right. We got our own tucker and everything.’  We saw this was true. The two old women had large ﬂax kits of food.  ‘No liquor?’ my father said suspiciously. ‘I don’t want any drinking round my place.’  ‘No,’ Tom replied. His face was still patient. ‘No liquor. We don’t plan on any drinking.’  The other young men shyly agreed in the background. It was not, they seemed to say, an occasion for drinking.  ‘Well,’ said my father stifﬂy, ‘I suppose it’s all right. Where are you going to take him?’ He nodded towards the old sleeping man.  ‘Just across your land. And up to the old pa.’  ‘I didn’t know there used to be any pa round here.’  ‘Well,’ said Tom. ‘It used to be up there.’ He pointed out the largest hill behind our farm, one that stood well apart and above the others. We called it Craggy Hill, because of limestone outcrops. Its ﬂanks and summit were patchy with tall scrub. We seldom went near it, except perhaps when out shooting; then we circled its steep slopes rather than climbed it. ‘You’d see the terraces,’ Tom said, ‘if it wasn’t for the scrub. It’s all hidden now.’  Now my father looked strangely at Tom. ‘Hey,’ he said, ‘You sure you aren’t having me on? How come you know that hill straight off? You ever been here before?’  ‘No,’ Tom said. His face shone as he sweated with the effort of trying to explain everything. ‘I never been here before. I never been in this part of the country before.’  ‘Then how do you know that’s the hill, eh?’  ‘Because,’ Tom said simply, ‘the old men told me. They described it so well I could find the place blindfold. All the stories of our tribe are connected with that hill. That’s where we lived, up there, for hundreds of years.’  ‘Well, I’ll be damned. What do you know about that?’ My father blinked, and looked up at the hill again. ‘Just up there, eh? And for hundreds of years.’  ‘That’s right.’  ‘And I never knew. Well, I’ll be damned.’  ‘There’s lots of stories about that hill,’ Tom said. ‘And a lot of battles fought round here. Over your place.’  ‘Right over my land?’  ‘That’s right. Up and down here, along the river.’  My father was so astonished he forgot to be aloof. He was trying to fit everything into his mind at once — the hill where they’d lived hundreds of years, the battles fought across his land — and it was too much. The People Before 209  ‘The war canoes would come up here,’ Tom went on. ‘I reckon they’d drag them up somewhere here’ — he indicated the grassy bank on which we were standing — ‘in the night, and go on up to attack the pa before sunrise. That’s if we hadn’t sprung a trap for them down here. There’d be a lot of blood soaked into this soil.’ He kicked at the earth beneath our feet. ‘We had to ﬁght a long while to keep this land here, a lot of battles. Until there was a day when it was no use fighting any more. That was when we left.’  We knew, without him having to say it, what he meant. He meant the day when the European took the land. So we all stood quietly for a moment. Then my mother spoke. ‘You’d better come up to the house,’ she said. ‘I’ll make you all a cup of tea.’  A cup of tea was her solution to most problems.  We went up to the house slowly. The young men followed behind, carrying the litter. They put the old man in the shade of a tree, outside the house. Since it seemed the best thing to do, we all sat around him; there wouldn’t have been room for everyone in our small kitchen anyway. We waited for my mother to bring out the tea.  Then the old man woke. He seemed to shiver, his eyes opened wide, and he said something in Maori. ‘He wonders where he is,’ Tom explained. He turned back to the old man and spoke in Maori.  He gestured, he pointed. Then the old man knew. We all saw it the moment the old man knew. It was as if we were all willing him towards that moment of knowledge. He quivered and tried to lift himself weakly; the old women rushed forward to help him. His eyes had a faint glitter as he looked up to the place we called Craggy Hill. He did not see us, the house, or anything else. Some more Maori words escaped him in a long, sighing rush. ‘Te Wahiokoahoki,’ he said.  ‘It is the name,’ Tom said, repeating it. ‘The name of the place.’  The old man lay back against the women, but his eyes were still bright and trembling. They seemed to have a life independent of his wrinkled ﬂesh. Then the lids came down, and they were gone again. We could all relax.  ‘Te Wahiokoahoki,’ Tom said. ‘It means the place of happy return. It got the name when we returned there after our victories against other tribes.’  My father nodded. ‘Well, I’ll be damned,’ he said. ‘That place there. And I never knew.’ He appeared quite affable now.  My mother brought out tea. The hot cups passed from hand to hand, steaming and sweet.  ‘But not so happy now, eh?’ Tom said. ‘Not for us.’  ‘No. I don’t suppose so.’  Tom nodded towards the old man. ‘I reckon he was just about the last child born up there. Before we had to leave. Soon there’ll be nobody left who lived there. That’s why they wanted young men to come back. So we’d remember too.’  Jim went into the house and soon returned. I saw he carried the greenstone adzes he’d found. He approached Tom shyly.  ‘I think these are really yours,’ he said, the words an effort.  Tom turned the adzes over in his hand. Jim had polished them until they were a vivid green. ‘Where’d you get these, eh?’ he asked. m‘a. . a 4                 210 Stories of Ourselves  Jim explained how and where’d he found them. ‘I think they’re really yours,’ he  repeated. There was a brief silence. Jim stood with his eyes downcast, his treasure surrendered.  My father watched anxiously; he plainly thought Jim a fool. ‘You see,’ Jim added apologetically, ‘I didn’t think they really belonged to anyone.  That’s why I kept them.’ ‘Well,’ Tom said, embarrassed. ‘That’s real nice of you. Real nice of you, son. But  you better keep them, eh? They’re yours now. You find, you keep. We got no claims here any more. This is your father’s land now.’  Then it was my father who seemed embarrassed. ‘Leave me out of this,’ he said sharply. ‘You two settle it between you. It’s none of my business.’  ‘I think you better keep them all the same,’ Tom said to Jim.  Jim was glad to keep the greenstone, yet a little hurt by rejection of his gift. He received the adzes back silently.  ‘I tell you what,’ Tom went on cheerfully, ‘you ever find another one, you send it to me, eh? Like a present. But you keep those two.’  ‘All right,’ Jim answered, clutching the adzes. He seemed much happier. ‘I promise if I find any more, I’ll send them to you.’  ‘Fair enough,’ Torn smiled, his face jolly. Yet I could see that he too really wanted the greenstone.  After a while they got up to leave. They made the old man comfortable again and lifted him. ‘We’ll see you again tomorrow,’ Tom said. ‘The launch will be back to pick us up.’  ‘Tomorrow?’ my father said. It hadn’t occurred to him that they might be staying overnight on his land. ,  ‘We’ll make ourselves a bit of a camp up there tonight,’ Tom said, pointing to Craggy Hill. ‘We ought to be comfortable up there. Like home, eh?’ The jest fell mildly from his lips.  ‘Well, I suppose that’s all right.’ My father didn’t know quite what to say. ‘Nothing you want?’  ‘No,’ Tom said. ‘We got all we want, thanks. We’ll be all right. We got ourselves. That’s the important thing, eh?’  We watched them move away, the women followed by the young men with the litter. Tom went last, Jim trotting along beside him. They seemed, since the business of the greenstone, to have made friends quickly. Tom appeared to be telling Jim a story.  I thought for a moment that my father might call Jim back. But he didn’t. He let him go.  The old women now, I noticed, carried green foliage. They beat it about them as they walked across our paddocks and up towards Craggy Hill; they were chanting or singing, and their wailing sound came back to us. Their figures grew smaller with distance. Soon they were clear of the paddocks and beginning to climb.  My father thumbed back his hat and rubbed a handkerchief across his brow. ‘Well, I’ll be damned,’ he said. The People Before 211  We sat together on the porch that evening, as we often did in summer after milking and our meal. Yet that evening was very different from any other. The sun had set, and in the dusk we saw faint smoke rising from their campfire on Craggy Hill, the place of happy return. Sometimes I thought I heard the wailing sound of the women again, but I couldn’t quite be sure.  What were they doing up there, what did they hope to find? We both wondered and puzzled, yet didn’t speak to each other.  Jim had returned long before, with stories. It seemed he had learned, one way and another, just about all there was to be learned about the tribe that had once lived on Craggy Hill. At the dinner table he told the stories breathlessly. My father affected to be not much interested; and so, my father’s son, did I. Yet we listened, all the same.  ‘Then there was the first musket,’ Jim said. ‘The first musket in this part of the country. Someone bought it from a trader down south and carried it back to the pa. Another tribe, one of their old enemies, came seeking utu — utu means revenge — for something that had been done to them the year before. And when they started climbing up the hill they were knocked off, one by one, with the musket. They’d never seen anything like it before. So the chief of the tribe on Craggy Hill made a sign of peace and called up his enemies. It wasn’t a fair fight, he said, only one tribe with a musket. So he’d let his enemies have the musket for a while. They would have turns with the musket, each tribe. He taught the other tribe how to fire and point the musket. Then they separated and started the battle again. And the next man to be killed by the musket was the chief’s eldest son. That was the old man’s uncle — the old man who was here today.’  ‘Well, I don’t know’, said my father. ‘Sounds bloody queer to me. That’s no way to fight a battle.’  ‘That’s the way they fought,’ Jim maintained.  So we left Jim, still telling stories to my mother, and went out on the porch.  The evening thickened. Soon the smoke of the campfire was lost. The hills grew dark against the pale sky. And at last my father, looking up at the largest hill of all, spoke softly.  ‘I suppose a man’s a fool,’ he said. ‘I should never have let that land go. Shouldn’t ever have let it go back to scrub. I could have run a few sheep up there. But I just let it go. Perhaps I’ll burn it off one day, run a few sheep. Sheep might pay better too, the way things are now.’  But it wasn’t somehow, quite what I expected him to say. I suppose he was trying to make sense of things in his own fashion.  III  They came down off Craggy Hill the next day. The launch had been waiting for them in the river some time.  When we saw the cluster of tiny figures, moving at a fair pace down the hills, we sensed there was something wrong. Then, as they drew nearer, approaching us across the paddocks, we saw what was wrong. There was no litter, no old man. They all walked freely, separately. They were no longer burdened. 212 Stories of Ourselves  Astonished, my father strode up to Tom. ‘Where is he?’ he demanded.  ‘We left him back up there,’ Tom said. He smiled sadly and I had a queer feeling that I knew exactly what he would say.  ‘Left him up there?’  ‘He died last night, or this morning. When we went to wake him he was cold. So we left him up there. That’s where he wanted to be.’  ‘You can’t do that,’ my father protested. ‘You can’t just leave a dead man like that. Leave him anywhere. And, besides, it’s my land you’re leaving him on.’  ‘Yes,’ Tom said. ‘Your land.’  ‘Don’t you understand? You can’t just leave dead people around. Not like that.’  ‘But we didn’t just leave him around. We didn’t just leave him anywhere. We made him all safe and comfortable. He’s all right. You needn’t worry.’  ‘Christ, man,’ my father said. ‘Don’t you see?’  But he might have been asking a blind man to see. Tom just smiled patiently and said not to worry. Also he said they’d better be catching the launch. They had a long way to go home, a tiring journey ahead.  And as he walked off, my father still arguing beside him, the old women clashed their dry greenery, wailing, and their shark-tooth necklaces danced under their heaving throats.  In a little while the launch went noisily off down the river. My father stood on the bank, still yelling after them. When he returned to the house, his voice was hoarse.  He had a police party out, a health officer too. They scoured the hills, and most of the caves they could find. They discovered no trace of a burial, nor did they find anything in the caves. At one stage someone foolishly suggested we might have imagined it all. So my father produced the launchman and people from the township as witnesses to the fact that an old Maori, dying, had actually been brought to our farm.  That convinced them. But it didn’t take them anywhere near finding the body. They traced the remnants of the tribe, living up the coast, and found that indeed an old man of the tribe was missing. No one denied that there had been a visit to our farm. But they maintained that they knew nothing about a body. The old man, they said, had just wandered off into the bush; they hadn’t found him again.  He might, they added, even still be alive. Just to be on the safe side, in case there was any truth in their story, the police put the old man on the missing persons register, for all the good that might have done.  But we knew. We knew every night we looked up at the hills that he was there, somewhere.  So he was still alive, in a way. Certainly it was a long time before he let us alone.  And by then my father had lost all taste for the farm. It seemed the land itself had heaped some final indignity upon him, made a fool of him. He never talked again, anyway, about running sheep on the hills.  When butter prices rose and land values improved, a year or two afterwards, he had no hesitation in selling out. We shifted into another part of the country entirely, for a year or two, and then into another. Finally we found ourselves milking a small herd for town The People Before 213  supply, not far from the city. We’re still on that farm, though there’s talk of the place being purchased soon for a city sub—division. We think we might sell, but we’ll face the issue when it arises.  Now and then Jim comes to see us, smart in a city suit, a lecturer at the university. My father always found it difﬁcult to talk to Jim, and very often now he goes off to bed and leaves us to it. One thing I must say about Jim: he has no objection to helping with the milking. He insists that he enjoys it; perhaps he does. It’s all ﬂatland round our present farm, with one farm much like another, green grass and square farmhouses and pine shelter belts, and it’s not exactly the place to sit out on a summer evening and watch shadows gathering on the hills. Because there aren’t hills within sight; or shadows either, for that matter. It’s all very tame and quiet, apart from cars speeding on the highway.  I get on reasonably well with Jim. We read much the same books, have much the same opinions on a great many subjects. The city hasn’t made a great deal of difference to him. We’re both married, with young families. We also have something else in common: we were both in the war, fighting in the desert. One evening after milking, when we stood smoking and yarning in the cool, I remembered something and decided I might put a question to Jim.  ‘You know,’ I began, ‘they say it’s best, when you’re under fire in the war, to fix your mind on something remote. So you won’t be afraid. I remember Dad telling me that. I used to try. But it never seemed any good. I couldn’t think of anything. I was still as scared as hell.’  ‘I was too. Who wasn’t?’  ‘But, I mean, did you ever think of anything?’  ‘Funny thing,’ he said. ‘Now I come to think of it, I did. I thought of the old place — you know, the old place by the river. Where,’ he added, and his face puckered into a grin, ‘where they buried that old Maori. And where I found those greenstones. I’ve still got it at home, you know, up on the mantelpiece. I seem to remember trying to give it away once, to those Maoris. Now I’m glad I didn’t. It’s my only souvenir from there, the only thing that makes that place still live for me.’ He paused. ‘Well, anyway, that’s what I thought about. That old place of ours.’  I had a sharp pain. I felt the dismay of a long-distance runner who, coasting conﬁdently to victory, imagining himself well ahead of the ﬁeld, ﬁnds himself overtaken and the tape snapped at the very moment he leans forward to breast it. For one black moment it seemed I had been robbed of something which was rightfully mine.  I don’t think I’ll ever forgive him.
