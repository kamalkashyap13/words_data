‘All the colors of the world ’ was one of the ﬁrst slogans to appear in Benetton ads, and was later altered to ‘United Colors of Benetton’. The concept of united colors was such  a strong one that for the ﬁrst time in its history, the company adopted the slogan as its  actual logo. For the ﬁrst time in the history of commercial trademarks, the slogan United Colors of Benetton became a trademark, a trademark that became the driving force behind the ‘United Colors’ message, which formed the basis of the advertising visuals  designed to create a growing network of ‘United People’. These images showed youth of both sexes and every skin tone, who conveyed a message of harmony, energy and joy.

I am very excited that tomorrow is our biggest event of the year, when we celebrate New Year, the first day of the lunar calendar. This has its origin in folklore, and celebrates the time when people try to scare away a demon called ‘Festival’ by using the colour red and setting off firecrackers. Red symbolises luck, peace and fortune. The fireworks also bring in new hope for the future and get rid of the bad luck from the past year. There is a twelve-year cycle of animal names; this is the year of the Rabbit and next year will be the Dragon, a really special one.  Tonight we shall watch a spring gala of comedies and songs performed in traditional costume, lasting for four or five hours. We shall eat dumplings for dinner, which occurs exactly at midnight. Our house and the street outside have been decorated with red silk banners and messages of good will.  Tomorrow we shall give presents to family members and friends to wish them well in the coming year. We must say ‘Xin Nian Kuai Le’ to everyone we meet, which means ‘Happy New Year’. Gifts of money are given to children. In the evening we shall watch the TV programme which everyone watches on this day. It is the most exciting day of the year for Chinese people. Wishing you ‘Xin Nian Kuai Le’.


 I’d get up between six and seven, which is when I wake up. I’d go downstairs before anyone else in the family was up to feed my outdoor pets and take my dog for a walk. I live in the country so there are quiet places to go where no one else goes. I’d return for breakfast, by which time the rest of the family would be up. I’d have pancakes with golden syrup, because they’re a treat which we don’t have on normal school days. Then my friends would come to my house and we’d play games in the garden, if the weather was good, or in my bedroom. We’d lose track of the time and no one would come and see what we were doing or tell us off for making a mess. I wouldn’t have any homework to do, of course, or any chores like tidying my room, so I wouldn’t have to do anything I didn’t want to do.

There’d be a big lunch, with all my favourite food, including chocolate cake, and afterwards we’d watch a DVD, something just out and that I’d been looking forward to seeing. It would probably be a comedy or a fantasy film. We’d lie on the floor with cushions and have some popcorn or other snacks while we watched. After that we’d go out to get some exercise, either for a bike ride or to play sport. We have a basketball court nearby and that’s my favourite game at the moment.
Before the evening meal — which would be pizza or fried chicken — I’d go for a walk with my best friend and my dog, down to the nearby river, and we’d just talk about everything happening at school, and to the people we know, and about our next holidays. I’d probably take some photos with my phone or digital camera for a laugh. If it were really hot we’d swim and then dry off lying on the river bank, with a cool drink. I’d take my MP3 player and we’d listen to some of my favourite bands, sharing the ear piece between us.

At the end of the day, after my friend had left, l’d join my family for supper and find out what they’d been doing all day. I’d play a board game with my brother or sister, if I could persuade them. We’d sit outside on the balcony and watch the sunset and listen to the bird and animal noises if it was summer, or in winter we’d sit on the rug in front of the fire. About nine o’clock I’d go to my room, feeling pleasantly tired and ready to  read an exciting adventure story in bed until I fell asleep.

My favourite things
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,
Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens,
Brown paper packages tied up with strings,
These are a few of my favourite things.
Cream coloured ponies and crisp apple strudels,
Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles.
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings,
These are a few of my favourite things.
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,
Silver white winters that melt into springs,
These are a few of my favourite things.
When the dog bites, when the bee stings,
When I’m feeling sad,
I simply remember my favourite things,
And then I don’t feel so bad.

Pasta! My favourite food has to be pasta. It's only flour and water, but it makes delicious meals. It was being eaten in Italy a thousand years ago —and the Italians know about good food. It's also the land of pizza, my second favourite! If you make it yourself, instead of buying it in packets in the supermarket, it tastes wonderful, but it's hard work because there are many stages: it has to be kneaded, rolled, cut and dried. This was made easier by the invention of machines to do this work in the early 19th century. Pasta's taste buddy is the tomato, of course. You can't imagine pasta 
without tomatoes can you? It would be like bread without butter. But for the Italians pasta is just the starter, the first of three courses for every meal, and they often eat it with just olive oil and herbs. What I love about pasta is that it comes in all shapes and sizes, and you can choose which one suits your mood, and the sauce accompaniment. Some of them have a stuffing, some of them are difficult to twirl on your fork, and there are different colours too: white, green and orange, depending on whether egg, spinach or tomato has been added to the durum wheat paste. 

So every pasta meal can be as different and as challenging as you want it to be. There are several hundred varieties, coming from all the different regions of Italy, and there's a reason why every one of them looks the way it does, and has the name it does: little 
worms, little ears, little tongues, butterflies, shells. Such interesting and appropriate names! Apparently long stringy types are best for smooth sauces, while grooves and shapes hold chunkier ones. My favourite has to be slippery, slurpy, snaky spaghetti! 

Grey is the light at the end of the day.

Grey is the ancient head full of wisdom.

Grey is the perilous path leading to the cave.
Grey is the silken spider’s web in the corner.
Grey is the smoke from the factory chimney
Grey are the waves of the angry sea.

Grey are the stones of the prison wall.

Grey are the clouds gathering on the horizon.
Grey are the birds that fly away from the cold.
Grey are the eyes that are glued to TV.

Autumn for me is

an indescribable earthy smell,

skies palest blue to crimson hue,

mists unravelled by the sun,

spiders ’ webs sparkling with dew,

a lonely owl hooting in the night,

smoke from bonfires heavenward trailing,
birds ’ nests looking frayed forgotten,
rose-red apples, ripe and sweet,
wind-whirling, swirling, twirling leaves
bracken-brown undergrowth, heather-covered hills
last petals falling to the ground
