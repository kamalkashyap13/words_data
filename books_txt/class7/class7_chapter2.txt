One cold winter night, sixteen-year old Kathy was home alone. Her parents had gone out to a dinner party. It had been snowing all that afternoon, but had recently stopped. After studying for a few hours Kathy decided to relax by lying on the couch and watching TV in the living room. The television was in front of the glass door that led to the back garden. By midnight Kathy’s parents still hadn’t come home and she was terriﬁed because she thought she had caught a glimpse of a very strange looking man staring at her, standing outside the glass sliding door behind the television. Shaking with fear, she pulled a blanket over herhead and grabbed the phone by her side. She called the police and in a few minutes officers arrived.
Kathy told them about the strange man who had been standing outside, staring in through the glass.  The police opened the sliding door and looked around. They explained that there could not have been anyone standing outside as there would be footprints in the snow. They told her that she was probably just overtired and had imagined it. As the ofﬁcers were about to leave, one of them stopped behind the couch Kathy was sitting on. His jaw dropped as he shouted, ‘Look here!’ Kathy looked: there were wet footprints on the carpet behind the couch. She hadn’t seen the man outside the door; she’d seen his reflection when he was standing behind her in the room!

About a month ago in Soweto, a man was on the side of the road hitch-hiking on a very dark night and in the middle of a storm.  No car went by, and the rain was so heavy he could hardly see a few metres ahead of him. Suddenly, a car came towards him and stopped. Without thinking about it, the man got in and closed the door, realising too late that there was nobody in the driver’s seat. The car started slowly. The man looked at the road, and he saw that a bend was approaching.  He was terrified, but just before he hit the curve a hand appeared through the window and moved the steering wheel. This happened again and again; every time there was a bend in the road, the hand took control. The man escaped from the car and ran to the nearest township.  Wet and in shock, he went into a cafe and told everybody there about the petrifying experience he had been through, and they were stunned into silence.  About half an hour later, two men entered the cafe and one said to the other, ‘Look, Lewa, there’s that idiot who got into our car when we were pushing it. ’


A terrible scream — a prolonged yell of horror and anguish — burst out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins. I gasped. ‘What is it? What does it mean? ’  Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.  ‘Hush! ’ he whispered. ‘Hush! ’  The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.  ‘Where is it?’ Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.  ‘There, I think. ’ I pointed into the darkness.

Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low, constant murmur of the sea.
‘The hound!’ cried Holmes. ‘Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are too late! ’
He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.
I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He stamped his feet upon the ground.
‘He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late. ’  ‘No, no, surely not! ’
Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.
‘Hark, what is that? ’
A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread — eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror.


Jim, the boy who ran away
There was a Boy whose name was Jim
His Friends were very good to him.
They gave him Tea, and Cakes, and Jam
And slices of delicious Ham

And Chocolate with pink inside

Now, just imagine how it feels
When first your toes and then your heels
And then, by gradual degrees
Your shins and ankles, calves and knees
Are slowly eaten, bit by bit
No wonder Jim detested it
No wonder that he shouted Hi
The Honest Keeper heard his cry
Though very fat, he almost ran
To help the little gentleman
‘Ponto!’ he ordered as he came
(For Ponto was the Lion’s name)
‘Ponto!’ he cried, with angry Frown,
‘Let go, Sir! Down, Sir! Put it down
The Lion made a sudden Stop,
He let the Dainty Morsel drop,
And slunk reluctant to his Cage,
Snarling with Disappointed gage.
But when he bent down over Jim,
The Honest Keeper’s Eyes were dim.
The Lion having reached his Head
The miserable Boy was dead!
When Nurse informed his Parents, they
Were more Concerned than I can say:
His Mother, as She dried her eyes,
Said, ‘Well - it gives me no surprise,
He would not do as he was told!’
His Father, who was self-controlled,
Bade all the children round attend
To James’ miserable end,
And always keep a-hold of Nurse
For fear of finding something worse.

A saga is a long prose tale of the adventures and achievements of a hero.
A mini-saga is a narrative of exactly 50 words. Mini-sagas are often a
mixture of sad and amusing ideas, and have surprise twists at the end.
These five mini-sagas were written by Secondary I students.


I had longed to get rid of him for weeks. Finally, I had the chance.

I climbed the stairs, cautiously entered the room - and saw him

grinning in the mirror. The door slammed. A cry of agony, and it

was over. Wreathed in blood, my tooth dangled on the string.

I am thrown in with a crowd. The door slams shut. 

I hear gushing water. I feel redness oozing from me

colouring the water. Gasping for air, I am knocked 

out by arms and legs. I come round hanging on the 

washing line - a red sock among pale pink laundry. 

Another dawn. The frosty walk to the front line,

heart pounding, chest tight. He stands exposed,

And little Tricycles to ride

And read him stories through and through
And even took him to the Zoo

But there it was the dreadful Fate

M him, which I now relate.

You know - or at least you ought to know
For I have often told you so

That Children never are allowed

To leave their Nurses in a Crowd

Now this was Jim’s especial Foible

He ran away when he was able

And on this inauspicious day

He slipped his hand and ran away

He hadn’t gone a yard when - Bang
With open Jaws, a Lion sprang

And hungrily began to eat

The Boy: beginning at his feet

awaiting the inevitable onslaught. The first missiles whistle
overhead. The enemy’s roar rises to a crescendo. He must counter-
attack, already knowing the futility and tasting defeat. ‘Alright, 3C,
settle down. Let’s have some quiet!’

My teacher, Mrs Bailey, wears a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles.
They’re rounded, and perched there, glaring at you. One day

they fell! She perched them on again. The left lens said,

‘I hate looking at books. I want holidays in the sun. ’

Mrs Bailey only sees half the class now.

Sitting, watching, goggling at the box, his legs begin

to shrink. His bottom grows fatter and fatter, filling

the armchair he sits in, slowly at first, then faster and
faster. His eyes grow square instead of round. His head
slowly turns to jelly - from sitting in front of the telly.
