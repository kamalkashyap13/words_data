My father started the business in 1925, the year of my birth. It was a good business: roads were rough and tyres were punished. In those days, there was the inner tube, and the outer casing of hard rubber. I always saw these as the body and the soul. Don’t ask me why. '  The main road is very straight, and always has been: Roman, they say. In those days there wasn’t much traffic, although at the time we thought it was busy. Life would go by us, and now and again stop. We were proud that M. Michelin was a Frenchman: for once we had invented something useful, instead of making a lot of noise about nothing. No, really, I am. proud of our business.  I started helping my father as soon as I could stand upright, just as he had helped his father, who was a blacksmith, hammering hot iron tyres to wooden rims. I was at first scared of the hiss of the compressors, of the great blade that took off the rubber, peeling it like an orange. I learnt to see a tyre as sad, when its chin lay ﬂat on the ground, melting away — and when it was fat and full it bounced, it was so happy. My father could roll the tyres like a man I once saw in a circus that came to the village. The worn, sad ones lay leaning each upon the other like old men one side of the yard: my father would roll another so that it fell exactly into place against the end. He called this ‘playing his accordion”. Some of the farmers would take these old tyres away, for use on the farms, where they would have a second life under a trailer, bouncing behind a horse or perhaps a donkey over stony ﬁelds. In very hard frosts, they would heap up the old, dead tyres at the ends of the ﬁelds, so that the evil smoke would scare the frost away from the Vine—buds. Not everyone did this: it was my father’s idea, I believe, and they didn’t like to think he could tell them things, a man who had turned away from the land.  My father would tell me, when I was old enough, how one must never fall short of the highest standards, in this job. The road was getting busier, and the future looked rosy. But, he said, if you fall short of the highest standards, and start ‘cutting corners’, or grow sloppy, and let a man drive away with a set of tyres unevenly inﬂated, or with Tyres 397  an inner tube that — from the very kindest of intentions — you have pretended to yourself is passable, though frayed in one spot, or with a tread that is smooth as here (he’d smack his furrowed brow), you might be sending that man to his death. Every time we heard of a local accident, our hearts beat faster, and not only because this unfortunate occurrence might have involved someone dear to us; many, if not most, of those running around on the roads at that time were putting their faith in our rigour and honesty and skill. Even I, a pimply young lad handling the bicycle trade (how much more considerable it was in those days!) knew that my hands were capable of bringing injury or even death, if I let my attention wander, or felt too lazy to triple—check a pressure or a repair or a bolt or the depth of a tread.  The blessed Trinity, my father called it: the check, the double—check, and the Holy- Ghost-check. Who was a Protestant through and through.  Even the local curé would use us. My father and he drank together, in the little office with its Dunlop tyre—clock, talking about Verdun or other things closed to me, while I dealt with the curé’s battered old bicycle — a Raleigh, from his time in Flanders. M. Dunlop and M. Michelin: these were my father’s gods. I would like to say that my father was like the Michelin man, but he wasn’t: I was always, from maturity, bigger than he ever was, but he was never fat. His face has always had an emaciated look, perpetually sucking on its dead cigarette, glossy with grease and seamed with dirt. Tyres pick up the filth of the world, they are not fussy. In their treads I have found the hair and blood of small, hapless creatures. In the great chasms of a giant truck’s treads I once found a shrew, intact but quite lifeless, its tiny paws folded as my mother’s were on her death-bed, in the room smelling of camphor and candles.  So the road passed by us in a blur, and now and again would come the tell-tale sounds of tyres turning into our yard, scrunching over the grit. and dust, and we would lift our heads to look, squinting in the heat and glare or rubbing our hands in the cold.  André Paulhan et Fils. That sign was painted in 1942, when I was seventeen. I was very proud.  The next day, we saw our first German limousine. We had seen German trucks before, passing through the unoccupied zone, on their way to elsewhere, but never before had we seen a big, black Mercedes, with a little flag ﬂuttering on its bonnet, and motorcycle outriders. It did not stop. There was much less activity on the road, after the country was defeated, but my bicycle hands were kept busier. Our old tyres were soon used up, and new tyres were only fitfully available, until my father came to some agreement with the local powers in the town. We had no family there, except some distant cousin of my mother’s: we are all from further up, in the mountains, the Paulhans. There is a tiny village in the chestnut country, about ten kilometres from where we lived at the time (when we weren’t sleeping on the job, as happened two or three days in the week), which is mostly bats and ruined walls, and a Simple church. That was our village, once. At least, the mas was ours, and the mas was well nigh a village in itself. I won’t go into the reasons for our dispersion, or we shall be here all night. Sufﬁce to say that it was not for wanting to see the world, or the descent of the Holy Spirit one Pentecost! We go at each other hammer and tongs, still, the Paulhan clan, 398 Stories of Ourselves  until we are threatened. Then we hold as fast to each other as one of my tyres to its rim. We don’t meet much, these days.  One time, in March or April 1943, my father came back from town one day, looking very pleased with himself. He was scrubbed clean and in his best suit. He had left very early, before I had even shaved. He had spent the morning in the gendarmerie, he told me. ‘There are a few new faces I don’t know, but there is Jules, getting along fine, with his own ofﬁce. He is in charge of regularising.’ ‘What is he regularising?’ I asked (There were no clients about, I might add.) ‘The STO,’ he said. My heart came into my mouth. By this he meant the latest bad idea of Laval’s, the Service du Travail Obligatoire. Jules — an old schoolfriend and card-playing companion of my father’s _ did no more than type out lists and send out letters, but he had a certain control over things. Jules had shown my father round, ‘and I shook a few hands.’ Just as well he had scrubbed his own, as best he could. That is why I escaped the fate of certain others of my age, amongst them several friends. When I was twenty, I spent a few not unpleasant months in the Vosges cutting wood and gathering charcoal and getting very cold with some young people from places like Lyon — smart, educated people, who had never cut wood in their lives before. But I never went to Germany.  Whether it was because of this visit, and his odd evening with Jules playing for small money and drinking, I do not know — but the Germans used us. That is to say, they used us when it suited them, for they seemed to have their own mechanics, even their own tyre people, like they had their own newspapers and their own films and their own language. Maybe they would have used us anyway, in that case, but my father saw it as his doing. The odd thing is, he hated the Germans — they had, after all, given him his limp, in ’17, and the itch would come back with heat. When the maquisards really got going, he didn’t turn them away, when they came as clients. He served them and pretended that he didn’t know, but somehow those boys never paid, only shook hands. But he said to me, one day, after the famous ‘Petit Ours’ (tall and elegant) had had a tube repaired on his motorcycle one evening, late: ‘Don’t get mixed up in all that. These boys, they are free. You are not. When all this is finished with, and those bastards are back in Berlin, that sign will have your name on it, and your son will be le ﬁls. I will be the old fellow who stands watching the world go by, and getting in your hair, and proving, at ninety, what a damn good grip I still have at the expense of your clients’ knuckles!’ He laughed uproariously at this, but I think he was nervous, inside. I suppose he was playing a delicate game. He was a man who could never take risks. It was moulded into him, it was part of his job.  When old Mme Renouvin slid off the road in her little blue Peugeot, in 1938, and was found dead as a log in a wild rose bush, where she’d been thrown, and the repOrt in the local paper blamed it on a ‘blow—out’, my poor father did not eat for days, like a fast of repentance. The fact is, Mme Renouvin was the worst driver anywhere, and in those days you could smooth out a tread in months if you took corners poorly, the surfaces were that gritty. But she was a client, and the last man to have dealt with her tyres was my father. Surprisingly, there was no decline in custom. That, as I said, came with the war, when the road traffic died away to near silence, and everyone went hungry. Tyres 399  If we hadn’t had the chestnuts, in our area, I think we might have starved to death. So my father’s visit to the gendarmerie certainly put things straight.  I was in love, if there is such a thing. It was a girl who passed by on her silver bicycle every morning and every evening. She was a clerk in the silk—works, further up the road. She would work all day in the roar of the river—race and the typewriter clicking away like a mad nuthatch, and I would work in the hiss of the compressor and the clatter of my tools and the intermittent gossip of our clients, dreaming of Sunday, when I could walk in the woods and mountains, and breathe good air, and forget the war. I noticed her first as a very young girl, just coming into womanhood, when she arrived in the yard with a tyre in ribbons, and caught her ankle on the pedal, walking the bicycle towards me. She was nothing much to look at then, except for a mass of beautiful, glossy black hair, but she spoke in a very sweet, soft voice, and had a winning smile. She hardly looked at me, and (both being shy, I suppose) we exchanged only a few commonplaces. But some dart must have wormed its way in, for when I saw her pass on her way to work (as I surmised, and soon confirmed) I recognised her immediately. This must have been just after the war broke out, in ’40. I remember poppies between the vines, and the white asphodels that came up always (and still do) in the good-for-nothing field at the back, and the poplars on the river glittering like fountains in a wind — so it would have been late spring. The dust was on the road; the last of the big rains had passed a few weeks earlier. The whole stretch of the road, either way, was empty (just before all those refugees from the north trudged past, with their wheelbarrows, in June); the poppies thinned into one crimson thread of silk either side, and the plane trees dappled nobody but the birds, alighting while the coast was clear. Rubbing my hands on a rag, taking a moment’s break between two jobs, I saw coming up from the west, from the town, a dark-haired figure on a bicycle. I stepped back as she drew nearer: I am naturally shy, as I have said, and in the long time it takes for a bicyclist to pass us from first sighting there is much that can happen in the head, and many possibilities for difficult exchanges of regard. As I recognised her from my slightly retracted vantage point, I have to say that I blushed; she was already hot in the face from the ride — but anyway, her skin was so olive that one never saw her blush. My skin is from my mother’s side; my mother had red hair, which everyone claimed was from German mercenaries a thousand years ago. What rubbish people speak!  I nodded as she passed, busily washing my hands over the pail. There was a wealthy client, a local meat-supplier, talking with my father, coming out of the big shed. He showed me a three—inch nail that had just been taken out of his nearside rear tyre. I indicated my admiration and commiseration, as one always has to with these bores, and then looked after the girl, who had now dwindled to a dot. I forgot to say that as she ticked past, just before the bore opened his mouth, she glanced at me and smiled. Her lips fell into an open pout as they automatically described a banjour, but mine stayed frozen. They are like that: the muscles of my face have a will of their own, at times. It is because I am shy, with people, unless they are clients. Also, it was because my voice had only just broken, and still threatened to be all at sixes-and—sevens. It was after this that my father gave me a lecture on treating clients as if they are the most 400 Stories of Ourselves  interesting people in the world, with their tedious, repetitive histories of three-inch nails and roads full of sharp stones.  times six days a week, but it took two years before I had reached a sufficient maturity to wave at her as she passed, and shout some innocuous greeting (I mean, more than bonjour or bonsoir). The final ‘breakthrough’ came after three years when, pedalling towards me at the time I just ‘happened’ to be wiping my hands on a rag at the edge of the road (which is also, of course, the generous entrance to our yard), she wobbled and wandered a little towards the middle of the road. Seeing, as I could, a large military vehicle bearing up behind her at considerable speed, I waved my hand and shouted at her to keep well in. The military vehicle swirled the dust so much that I was not certain for a few moments of her safety, but she emerged from the cloud, hugging the verge,  clownish shrug, making her laugh. On her way back that evening, when I just happened to be washing my hands in the pad under the old Michelin sign, with its tyre—man pointing potential clients in, the ticking slowed and stopped before I had time even to i look up. ‘Thank you’, she said. I stood, wiping my hands on my overalls (normally I would shake them dry, on such a fine day, because my overalls were of course greasy, but I could not shake them free of moisture with her so near). ‘That’s all right,’ I said. ‘ We couldn’t think of anything else to say for the moment, but it didn’t matter. I was ‘ aware of my father hammering in the shed, and of a sleek black Milice—type car i shooting past, and of a couple of motorcycles stinking of some home—made fuel — dung,                       Look at me there, in the yard, still the boy who knows nothing of the world, or keeps mum about it if he does. I was ﬁlled, let’s be honest about it, with a sense of helplessness and near—panic, for this might be the only opportunity I would ever get. Once I had seen her in the market, when my father had heard of an exceptional delivery of Normandy apples and sent me off in a client’s ‘borrowed’ car to grease the vendor’s palm. But it was so odd to see her then, stood like anyone else on the ground, and not on two spinning wheels, ticking past, that I failed to do justice to the occasion by positioning myself next to her with some joke at the ready, as many a lad of my age Tyres 401  might have done. A few other times I had reckoned I had seen her, at a distance, in one of the streets or on the main square of the town, but she had never come for repairs, or a new tyre. That’s what it was like, during the war: people dealt with their own problems, their own repairs, more than in peacetime. Everyone ‘cut corners’, from necessity. It was a difficult period.  So I was glad when she pointed at the nearest pot—hole and said, ‘I was avoiding one of those.’ This gave me an opportunity to open up. ‘It’s the military vehicles that do it,’ I said. ‘The roads can’t take them. The surface is battered stupid by all the trucks.’ (This was about six months after the German invasion of the southern zone, by the way.) ‘We are all battered,’ she said. She looked sad, then, and I noticed how her face had thinned over the three years I had watched her. If she lived up in one of the Villages to the north, she must bicycle a lot of kilometres each day, on a diet of boiled chestnuts or whatever. There was something sinewy about her, though, that one could trust. I nodded. I was conscious of my father in the shed, and how he’d told me to keep my mouth shut. ‘Petit Ours,’ she said, all of a sudden. I felt renewed panic, inside. I frowned. She looked at me, thoughtfully, as if reading my face. Then, because I didn’t say anything more, she set off into the distance. ‘Chatting up the skirts, then?’ yelled my father, from the shed door. ‘Hey, young Raoul’s picking the cherries as they pass!’ There was no one around, and his joke was lost to the air, after echoing as usual in the shed’s cavern behind him. I told him to piss off, under my breath. I was exhilarated and at the same time very upset that the girl (whose name I didn’t even know) was involved in some way with the Maquis. It never occurred to me that she might be working for the other side: that possibility might have been suggested by my feigned ignorance, but that was an automatic reﬂex. You’ve no idea on how many levels one’s mind worked, in those days: isolated compartments of body and soul, with a lotlbf soft rubber in between.  I was upset not only because her existence might suddenly be perilous, but also because she had not stopped just for me, or for her feelings about me. In the end, I never knew how deeply involved she was, but I reckon it must have been on the simplest level of message-carrying, like a lot of kids and teenagers in those times. My position, on the main road, with the cover of the business, would have served the Resistance well. That was obvious. But I was not the one to make that sort of decision alone. Maybe my father did more than just give the maquisards ‘God’s credit’, as he used to call it; but if so, I never knew about it — and trust between father and son would mean nothing, in that case.  The Germans — and, naturally, the Milice — started to furnish us with increased custom as the war dragged on and things became more and more difﬁcult. Since many of our clients were paying us in blackmarket goods, the ‘honest’ cash of the occupiers was very welcome. One day, I was sitting in a cafe on a Sunday morning (the place in the tiny square this side of town), when a man in a peasant’s overalls (but not, somehow, a peasant’s bearing), sat down next to me and said, ‘Try a nail or two. Otherwise we’ll be thinking you are collaborators.’ With that, he got up and left. My hands were shaking so much I spilt my drink. I imagined the other, mainly old, men in the cafe” were looking at me. The wine tasted sour (it probably was). This was about a 402 Stories of Ourselves  month after the girl had stopped to thank me. I decided to do something clownish, to make her stop again. My heart thumping like a drum all night, I rose early and started work before my father had shaved (we were ‘sleeping in’, that night, in the little rooms above the office). I had never missed her in the morning, but I wanted to be absolutely certain. The advantage of the morning encounter was that my father always did his paperwork until nine, and the thick net curtain across the office window obscured the view of the yard sufficiently to waylay any casual glance — even that of my father’s. At a quarter to seven, with the sun laying broad stripes across the white road, so that vehicles seemed to appear and disappear as they approached, I saw the girl in the distance . . . to my relief, I have to say (nothing can be relied on except death, and so forth). There was nobody else on the road. I stepped out into the middle with a bucket full of stones and earth and started to pour it into the pot—hole, the subject of our former exchange. I was so nervous I nearly dropped the bucket, for my arms were very weak all of a sudden, but I was already stamping the stuff down by the time she stopped. ‘You’ve no right to do that,’ she said. I paused in my work, and my prepared grin froze into what must have been rather a stupid-looking grimace. ‘You’ll be arrested for overstepping the mark. Les Allemands sont corrects.’ With that last familiar phrase, I knew she was ‘having me on’, and my grin restored itself. ‘It’s for you,’ I said. ‘I know,’ she replied. She giggled (no, not quite — but there is no other word to describe such a sprinkle of delightful, teasing merriment) and pedalled off. I was left gazing after her, empty bucket in hand, little stones caught in my boots. If a truck had not blared its horn, I fancy it would have run me over.  Of course, all doors were open now. My father wondered at my whistling gaiety that day. His eyes narrowed over lunch — which we’d have, on those summer days, at a little table set under the plane tree in the corner of the yard (the road is too noisy for that, now). He poured himself a generous quantity of wine and eyed me suspiciously over the tumbler. His face (no more nor less emaciated than it was before the war, just a little sharper) gleamed with sweat and grease. I smiled back, innocently. Despite the heat, a bird was singing in the branches above us. Or perhaps I imagined that. There was a noon stillness, otherwise — though the Germans never respected our hours, and would shatter the holy quiet at unpredictable moments. I saw the wine go down his throat as I had seen it go down for as long as I could remember, and the throat always glossy and dark. He wiped his mouth and set the glass down more energetically than usual. ‘Wipe that bloody stupid grin off your face,’ he said. ‘Or I’ll think you’re up to something.’  There was no doubt that the game he played was a strain on his nerves. I have no doubt that men like my non-peasant in peasant’s dress had approached him in recent months, when the bolts were turning tighter on our world. He must have felt cornered, in some way. He wouldn’t have liked that.  But if he didn’t like what was happening under his very nose, then he never said so. That evening she waved with a merry laugh as she passed, and my father was in the yard, jacking up a big white Delage (the one with the electric gearbox that belonged to M. Coutaud, the footwear fellow). I didn’t turn to look at him, but neither did he wolf- whistle, or yell something about cherries. The next morning was a Sunday, and I spent it roaming the hills around my family’s village, making myself giddy from too much Tyres 403     exercise combined with a lack of proper nourishment. We never talked about the war as such around the table: only the lack of food. Now and again the Germans trundled up the little main street, knocking plaster and even stone off the corners of the old buildings, matching their exaggerated wheelbase against the donkey—cart dimensions of the village turns, but otherwise the war was something that went on either far away, or in the subterranean parts of the mind and the land — places one only entered at one’s peril. Certainly — let me assure you of this — the Paulhans were never regarded as one of those salauds families who put all their eggs into the enemy basket. Many were the folk around us who looked upon the early days of Vichy as times of redemption for the poor, ground—down countryman, but they tended to be Catholics, who didn’t even mind very much when the Jews (including a few of our clients, most of whom I had never even thought of as Jews) were taken away. My father disliked Catholics with a two— hundred—year—old force ﬂowing in his veins. Thus he had no time for Pétain. Apart from anything else, he had put all his eggs into the basket of progress, which he saw as intimately connected with the automobile. Now we were living as people had been in his father’s time, or even his grandfather’s. To my father, the war was a personal attack on his business. Thus he felt no compunction in screwing what he could out of the enemy.  Do I make myself clear? There is nothing obscure about what followed. I will set it out like a spread of cards, as stained and smeared as my own, but no less honest. I lost, I lost more completely than most men lose . . . but let me go on. The girl and I, we slowly discovered each other; her name was Cecile Viala, she came from a small family that farmed in a simple, modest fashion two valleys west of mine, in a village I had never Visited — yet we decided that we must have crossed each other’s paths at numerous moments during our lives, if only at fairs and festivals, when we were to each other only another strange face under the trees.  She never again mentioned Petit Ours, or anything in connection with the Resistance, or even the war, very much. Twice a day we would talk, and she would arrive earlier and earlier, so as to talk for longer. She shook hands with my father, and my sisters soon learned of my ‘affair’. They teased me about it, but I was happy to be teased. They said I should invite her over, for they had learned how pleasant and pretty she was from someone who worked on the machines in the silk—works — and how clever she was, too, and what a ﬁne hand she had, and what a head for numbers; Far too good for a dolt like me! One morning, I said that I would be walking in her valley. (The idea popped into my head, just like that — really, it was not so far as the crow ﬂies, but then I am not a crow!) She looked down, shyly, and said, ‘I can be walking there, too.’ So we worked out a place to meet, in very sensible tones, as if we were talking about prices, or bent wheel-spokes — and as she pedalled off I realised that I had made my first secret assignation with the one I adored. I felt giddy, and even a little sick. I spread too much grease on the wheel-rims, and dropped a ring spanner on my toe. I had to sigh, as real lovers do — as if someone had taken a pump to my mouth and overdone the foot on the pedal. Each hiss of the tyres seemed to express my own impatience with the ordinariness of things: no young man could ever have been in love as much as I, I considered. Where my palm had rested on the warm leather of her 404 Stories of Ourselves  saddle, lay the cold arc of a jack’s brace. I turned it with a ferocity that my father happened not to see, or he would have cuffed me on the ear, as in old times.  We met under a certain, ancient chestnut tree already dropping its life—sustaining fruit, on the path that eventually winds up to her village. We avoided the shepherds and their tinkling goats as best we could, and made our way deeper into the woods. Neither of us said much, I remember. Without the long road, the yard, the trucks and bicycles, cars and horses, the dust or the puddles, the regularity of the moment twice in the day and the knowledge that it would not be extended beyond ten or so minutes, we were a little lost. The world was suddenly like an immense garden in which we could wander at will. Before a ﬁne view of the higher mountains to the north, blue fold upon blue fold, I took her hand. Yes — we had not yet held each other’s hand! Hers moved in my light hold, like a little rabbit, and I thought I was going to explode. I sighed as silently as I could, and then I said, ‘You make me very happy. I would like to do this every Sunday, even in winter, until I’m so old I can no longer walk.’ ‘What an odd thing to say!’ she cried. I felt very disappointed: I had rehearsed it all the way up the slope. Then she said, very quietly: ‘Me, too.’  Oh, let’s get on, let’s get on to the inevitable horror, after God alone knows what happiness of embrace and gentle kiss up there in those lonely, lovely hills. It will bear only brief telling. First, a big truck — a Latil, huge for those days, six cylinders, a twelve to thirteen tonner diesel — passed us one morning, six-thirtyish, at a hell of a lick, scattering grit and clouding the yard in dust. Moments later, two German armoured cars shot past, clearly in pursuit, and I heard a terrible tearing sound, which I believe was some kind of machine-gun fired by the Germans at the truck. My father and I ran out into the road, only to see the Latil swerve as if to turn — in fact, it slewed to a halt in a great vortex of white dust and the Germans did likewise, if only just in time. A ﬁgure leapt from the truck and ran off into the vines, with the Germans following on foot, firing like mad. We saw, over some obscuring trees, black smoke rise up in puffs and heard several loud bangs. These, I assume, were the grenades later reported in the local paper as having been thrown at the driver (who escaped, for he still lives to recount it). The truck was full of dynamite, which any one of the many bullets fired could have set off at any moment — and it was near enough to us to have taken our shed clean away. My father and I kept our heads down, as the Germans by this time (early in ’44) were very nervous and shot at anything that moved, if they felt it threatened them. But I wanted to warn Cecile, who was due to pass at any minute. To run up the road would have attracted fire, and even to go the back way, through the vineyards, would have been assumed suspicious by the Germans. So I walked up the road. ‘Where the hell are you going?’ yelled my father. ‘For a walk,’ I called back, and then kept going, keeping by the verge, with my hands in my pockets, looking as ordinary as possible but with terror beating in my mouth. I had, I think, a fifty—ﬁfty chance of attracting fire, but none came. When I saw Ce’cile, I waved, and she stopped. ‘You’re going to be late for work today,’ I said. She held my hand. She was quite startled to see me out of my usual place. She took the long, winding back route and arrived safely. My return was easier: the German guards, looking minuscule against the Latil, hardly seemed to look at me. There is nothing worse than facing danger with your spine. Tyres 405  That evening (by which time everything had been cleared up), Cecile thanked me with an open kiss. My father called me ‘a bloody fool’ and gripped my hand. He was proud of me, for once.  Then the village, one Sunday, was crossed with the darkest shadow of war — that of blood. We were sitting down to eat when the rumble of a convoy sounded. ‘Bloody Boche,’ murmured my father, followed by something ruder, in patois. A few minutes later there was shouting, and sounds of gunfire from the northern end of the village, near the little crossroads. There was lots of banging on doors, and we were all told to pay a visit to the Mairz'e. In the larger room, on the big table there used for the meetings of the Conseil Municipal, were laid three bodies. Their guts were literally looped and dripping almost to the ﬂoor, ripped open by that brief burst of gunﬁre. One of them was a local man, the son of the butcher, a little older than myself. The other two I did not know. They looked surprised in death, and it was said later that, though all three members were of the Maquis, no one knew why they had taken that road slap- bang into the German convoy, and then reversed in such panic. I know why: because, for all their bravery, they were mortals, and felt mortal fear. I was sick in the gutter, immediately afterwards, to my shame. We all — the whole village — ﬁled past the bodies and came out silent and pale. A few of us cried. I had never seen anything like it before, the only dead person I had ever looked at being my poor mother, at peace in her bed. The following week they looped a rope around the long neck of Petit Ours, whom they’d caught in a botched raid on the gendarmerie, and pushed him from the town bridge — over which the schoolchildren were forced to walk class by class in the afternoon, while the body swayed in the wind. The Mayor had to give a speech, thanking the Boche for keeping public order and so forth. The atmosphere was terrible. It crept up the road and cast my father and I, and most of our clients, into a deep gloom.  ‘But some of our clients, of course, were Germans. One, in particular, was a large, friendly man — and probably the very chap, as an ofﬁcer of the Gestapo, keeping an eye on things out here, who had ordered the execution of Petit Ours. His huge, soft-topped Maybach (of which he was very proud, and with good reason) needed a change of tyre about a fortnight later: a sharp stone had finally wormed its way in, on his way to the town. Both spare wheels, carried on each side of the bonnet, had been stolen, but we found the right fit. I remembered the words of the fellow in the café, and the ripped stomachs of the three good men, and the swaying body of Petit Ours, three days after his death, sending foul whiffs of gas up the river. In a shadowy corner of the shed, out of the bright sunlight, I took a brand new inner tube and quietly (though my father was in the office, talking with the fellow) shaved its rubber with a small steel file on a certain spot, until it looked frayed, but still just airtight. I placed this inner tube in the new tyre. The officer’s chauffeur and some other armed minion watched me fit it onto the wheel — the nearside front one — but I could scarcely stop my hands from trembling. In those days we tightened the bolts by hand with a box spanner, not a gun, so there was no risk of over—tightening, but I kept dropping the tommy bar with a big clatter. Anyway, I was giving the disk chrome a little polish by the time the big man himself stepped out of the ofﬁce. I saw him, in the mirror-ﬁnish of the chrome, advance 406 Stories of Ourselves  towards me, all distorted, looming over my shoulder like a big bat, and I composed my face and stood up. He pumped my hand and boomed at me about the state of the roads, and my father handed him the bill, which startled him. The fellow patted the bonnet and began to discuss the future of the automobile, while the two minions leaned on the sweeping mud-guard and smoked. His black gloves did a little dance while he talked. He must have been some sort of technical engineer before the war, for he was full of this idea that would avoid ‘grovelling in the road’ with a jack and getting your knees dirty: some sort of crowbar lever that would work a fitting under the bonnet, and put up either set of wheels as desired, and bring the whole car into suspension with a final twist. (A few years later, in about ’48, a British couple in sunglasses stopped for a puncture-repair in a 1.25 litre MG, and laughed when I searched for the jack. It had exactly the same system as the Gestapo officer had described, and I all but burst into tears. They did not understand my upset: they said something about the French having ‘a different sense of humour’ — which really means none at all, perhaps.)  While the man was boring us stupid with his broken French, booming from under his glossy peaked cap, his boots as polished as his coachwork, his jacket and breeches as black, I heard the ticking of a bicycle . . . but it cannot be Cécile’s, I thought, for there is a grating sound behind it. I glanced at the road — and there was, indeed, Cécile, coming to a halt at the entrance to the yard. She looked tired and worn, as we all did, after the events of the last few weeks. When she saw the Germans, and the big car, she made to go — but thinking only of how suspicious they were, and unpredictably sensitive and vengeful, I made my apologies and went over to greet her. ‘You should be ashamed,’ she murmured. ‘Don’t worry,’ I said. ‘It’s not as you think.’ Her face brightened, and then looked intense and questioning, and then spotting something over my shoulder, she as quickly disguised her interest behind a soft laugh. The officer had evidently been staring at her, for he then boomed his own greeting: ‘And might a fellow take a lift on the saddle from a pretty damsel, like a stick of bread?’ — some such tripe. She shook her head, adding: ‘No. My chain is loose.’ That explained the grating sound, and I offered immediately to mend it. We were nearly six kilometres from the town, and more again from her village. I noticed how sinewy her calves were, to the point of being wasted by effort and lack of proper food. She shook her head and pedalled away, without so much as a blown kiss or a wave. ‘Till Sunday!’ I shouted after her, recklessly. ‘Till Sunday, Cécile!’  There was a banging of doors, and the Maybach purred like a black, evil cat out of the yard, and turned to drive towards the town. It was at that moment that I saw Ce’cile, in the distance, apparently shudder to a stop. Her head bent down and I could just make out her hand between the wheels. Clearly, the chain had come off at that moment. I began to run towards her, my father shouting after me. The Maybach got there first. As I ran, an ominous sense of doom came over me: a kind of terrible chill, that made my heart slow, though it was pumping hard to keep my speed up. With a hundred yards to go, I saw the luggage locker opened, and Cécile’s bicycle placed in it. She appeared to be in conversation with the officer, for I spotted his black glove waving through the side window, like a little black snake’s tongue. The long and the short of it is that she was forced — I can only think that the appropriate word — forced by Tyres 407  circumstance (my belief is that she hoped to extract something useful from the enemy in that brief drive into the town) to accept his offer of a lift, gallant gentleman that he pretended to be. (Or perhaps was, in another airtight compartment of his brain.)  I was left coughing in a dust-cloud, for they accelerated away at great speed, as was typical — dwindling to a dot and out of sight in no time. I had not even had time to turn on my heel when there was a distant bang and clatter, as of heavy pots and pans falling off a shelf, and smoke began to drift above the plane trees. I ran as fast as I could, in the silence, but could not ﬁnally approach the spot for all the uniforms ringing it already, waving their guns — like excited kids around the blazing efﬁgy of the Petassou. For myself, though, it was the beginning of winter, not the end. I leave fresh ﬂowers every year, on the anniversary. The terrible scorch marks on the trunk have been long rubbed away by the rain and the sun and the wind, and the dent has grown out. The tree is well again — for we crop the branches close, here, as a matter of course.  I tried — I still try — to explain her presence in the car, but I am not sure, now, anyone really cares, or even remembers her very much. When my father ‘retired’, in ’69, I did no more than touch up André Paulhan et F ils; I could not change it, I could not paint it out. Well, I have had no sons, of course, staying unmarried — and anyway, he still hangs around the yard, getting in my hair (what little I have of it left to me), and showing clients what a ﬁrm grip he has, at ninety—odd. The road is very busy, of course - business could not be better. But something went out of the job when it all went tubeless, to my mind. I don’t suppose I will miss it. You’ll see the ﬂowers on your way in, to the left, tied to the trunk. When they begin to fade and wither, I replace them with the plastic type. To be honest, no one knows the difference — shooting past as they do,  these days.
