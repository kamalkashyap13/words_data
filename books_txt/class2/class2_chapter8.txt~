A fish breathes through its gills. Gills are slits in the fish’s skin. They are just behind the ﬁsh’s head. A fish waves its tail to move through the water. The tail is at the other end from the head.The fish’s skin is covered in scales. They help to protect the fish. Fish have several fins. They use their ﬁns to steer.
Fish live all around the world in seas, oceans, lakes, rivers and streams. Saltwater fish can only live in salty seasand oceans but freshwater ﬁsh live in rivers, lakes and streams that do not have salty water.
Saltwater ﬁsh live in places like coral reefs or sandy sea beds. Some ﬁsh live near underwater volcanoes. Most ﬁsh are saltwater ﬁsh because there is more salt water than freshwater. Saltwater ﬁsh include giant sharks and little clownﬁsh.
Fish are eaten by other ﬁsh, by birds and also by animals that live on land but hunt in water. They are also eaten by people. Freshwater ﬁsh are eaten by grizzly bears. Grizzly bears stand in rivers and catch the racing ﬁsh as they swim and leap. Polar bears eat saltwater ﬁsh. They dive deep into the ocean to catch their ﬁsh. Seals and sea lions eat a lot of ﬁsh because they are big animals. They spend most of each day hunting.

Coral reefs are like under water islands made of coral. Each coral is made up of tiny animals called polyps.
Polypshave hard shells. There are millions of polyps in every coral.
How do polyps make corals? Polyps stay in one place so their shells join together. Each coral has its own shape and colour. There are millions of corals on a coral reefso a coral reef is a very colourful place.
