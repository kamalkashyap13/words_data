It was a bright Cold day in April, and clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile Wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.  The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.  It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face  of a man of about forty—five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made  for the stairs. It was no use trying  the lift. Even at the best of times it , i  I  was seldom working, and at present the electric current  M   was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The ﬂat was seven ﬂights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.  Inside the ﬂat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of iron.  The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right—hand  wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.


Outside, even through the'shut Windowlpane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The black—moustachio’d face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston’s own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, ﬂapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving ﬂight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people’s windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.  Behind Winston’s back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it. Moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. You had to live — did live, from habit that became instinct — in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised.


2012 features your pretty standard disaster movie requirements: an array of scientific 
             nonsense, depictions of your favorite landmarks dying fiery deaths, and more people
             escaping-in-the-nick-of-time sequences than is worth counting. There are three separate
             scenes with airplanes taking off from runways being consumed by fire! Three!
             2012 is generally fun and has some unexpected twists in the story toward the end, so if you 
             haven't seen a movie with lots of explosions and not much thinking this may fit the bill. Expect 
             nothing intelligent about this movie and you'll be fine.
             The camera is always high and dry to give audiences the best panoramic view, but it re
             moves all tension from proceedings — you're always at a safe distance.
             Two and a half hours of heaving and cleaving and crashing and crunching.



2012 is the rare case of a bad film that I'm WE WERE WARNED
nevertheless obliged to recommend you see.
Most of all, I liked the airlifting of giraffes to 
ark safety via helicopter and the bizarrely un
reasonable cheeriness of the beleaguered survivors who all but shout 'hip-hip-hooray' after 
billions of other Earth citizens lose their lives.
I can't claim to have seen every terrible film in 
cinematic history, but in my fairly extensive 
`watchography', 2012 is certainly in the top five 
worst ever.
Gleefully over-the-top, this film takes the disaster movie pretty much as far as it can go.
Total popcorn entertainment with ridiculous 
dialogue and impossible situations and special 
effects that will boggle the brain for a good 
two-plus hours.
There's a whole world of destruction 
going on in the film's ridiculously excessive
special-effects sequences. But there's a 
whole lot of entertaining going on, too.
My enthusiasm for 2012 is not because I think it's high art with an important social message. 
This movie is about pure spectacle, and it pulls that off fabulously.
Bigger, louder, crazier and more wildly exhilarating than anything previously attempted.
Films of this sort are plotted shish kebab style: disaster, change of scenery, new disaster. But on 
the level of spectacle, 2012 is top-notch.
A preposterous, overlong mess that's filled with cheesy dialogue and cliche-ridden 
characters.
Remarkably, 2012 doesn't even really try to be profound, which is a good thing. All it tries to do 
is what it knows how to do best: entertain. At that, it comes up a winner.
A deliriously ludicrous, guilty pleasure of a blockbuster in which the end of the world is 
turned into a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride.
It's easy to scoff at the over-reliance of CGI in contemporary cinema but for a film like this
it's part and parcel of the whole, and computer-generated effects have never before been used 
as spectacularly.

 To enter out into that silence that was the city at eight 
           o'clock of a misty evening in November, to put your 
           feet upon that buckling concrete walk, to step over
           grassy seams and make your way, hands in pockets, 
           through the silences, that was what Mr Leonard Mead 
           most dearly loved to do. He would stand upon the
           corner of an intersection and peer down long moonlit 
           avenues of sidewalk in four directions, deciding which 
           way to go, but it really made no difference; he was
           alone in this world of 2053 A.D., or as good as alone, 
           and with a final decision made, a path selected, he
           would stride off, sending patterns of frosty air before 
           him like the smoke of a cigar.
               Sometimes he would walk for hours and miles and
           return only at midnight to his house. And on his way 
           he would see the cottages and homes with their dark 
           windows, and it was not unequal to walking through 
           a graveyard where only the faintest glimmers of firefly
           light appeared in flickers behind the windows. Sudden
           gray phantoms seemed to manifest upon inner room 
           walls where a curtain was still undrawn against the 
           night, or there were whisperings and murmurs where a 
           window in a tomb-like building was still open.

Mr Leonard Mead would pause, cock his head, listen, look, 
      and march on, his feet making no noise on the lumpy walk. For 
      long ago he had wisely changed to sneakers when strolling at 
      night, because the dogs in intermittent squads would parallel his 
      journey with barkings if he wore hard heels, and lights might 
      click on and faces appear and an entire street be startled by the 
      passing of a long figure, himself, in the early November evening.

 A shaft of sunlight fell across the worn herringbone floor, drawing 
     his gaze upwards to the flawless blue sky beyond the row of 
     windows, three metres above. It was a perfect summer's day. The 
     kind of day, many years ago, when he might have taken the dog and 
     run through the fields into the woods, climbed each of his favourite 
     trees, and returned filthy and exhausted in time for tea. No thoughts 
     of responsibility or duty. An unfettered spirit, in touch with himself 
     and every other living thing. No clues to the future, to what he 
     would, or would not, become.
       He glanced left and right. They were watching him, expecting 
     him to crumble, waiting for him to make a mistake. He daren't look 
     behind to see how many more there were, mute and expressionless. 
     A shudder ran through him.
       His mouth was dry but he knew a drink was out of the question. 
     Later, they'd smile apologetically, as though it were not their fault. 
     As though it were inevitable; everything he'd done so far, leading 
     to this.
       He swallowed, licked his lips. Would he crack? Would he tell them 
     what they wanted to know?
       All the training, all the years of preparation, seemed worthless. 
     He felt abandoned and defenceless in the face of what lay ahead 
     and he clenched his teeth to prevent the last of his courage from 
     escaping.
       He thought about his family: his parents' pride and expectations.
     He was going to disappoint them, betray their trust. Even worse, he was 
     going to let himself down.
 He regretted all the time wasted on things he couldn't even
    recall. If he concentrated, if he could turn back time for a week, a 
    month, a year, he could do it differently. Do it right. Tears pricked 
    his eyes and he screwed them tightly shut, wishing it was a dream 
    and he'd wake up, safe in his own bed, a carefree day stretching
    out before him.
       How much longer? The waiting was torture in itself, calculated 
    to undermine his confidence and shake the foundations of his 
    knowledge. Sweat trickled down between his shoulder blades, 
    prompting an involuntary twitch, and tension stretched his nerves
    until he expected an elastic snap as they gave way. It would come as a 
    relief. Anything was better than this.
       He studied the backs of his hands and inhaled deeply, forcing his 
    shoulders down. He didn't want them to see he was already losing the 
    battle. Flexing his fingers, he clasped his hands together, holding them 
    between his knees in an effort to stop the trembling. He was as ready 
    as he'd ever be.
       The door behind him swished open and clicked shut. Precise
    footsteps clipped a path towards him, their echo mocking his weakness. 
    He bowed his head and held his breath as they passed within inches 
    before stopping. This was it. His vision blurred and panic clawed
    his guts.
       A shrilling bell pierced the silence, followed by a brief, 
    collective sigh.
       `You may begin.'
       He turned over his exam paper, picked up his pen, and began 
    to write.
  How will we live in the future? Are 
               Star Trek fantasies of simulated- 
               reality holodecks and revolutionary
       foodstuffs going to come true? We can 
       suppose that many of the elements of what 
       will be commonplace in a few decades, or 
       even sooner, are already available to some 
       consumers, or at least to researchers.
          Key to much of our future lifestyle will be 
       the use of resources. Imagining the home of 
       the future is not simply about infusing more 
       glamour into the places we live in today,
       and perhaps adorning the bathroom with 
       LED lighting. What we can expect to see are 
       devices that are not only more efficient than 
       anything we have now but also provide greater 
       connectivity between people and machines,
       allowing them to 'talk' seamlessly to each other.lost, never lonely, never bored'. He sees new

My dear son, it is six o’clock in the morning on the island of
Hong Kong. You are asleep cradled in my left arm and I am
learning the art of one-handed typing. Your mother, more tired 
yet more happy than I’ve ever known her, is sound asleep in the
room next door and there is a soft quiet in our apartment.
Since you’ve arrived, days have melted into night and back
again and we are learning a new grammar, a long sentence
whose punctuation marks are feeding and winding and nappy 
changing and these occasional moments of quiet. 
When you’re older we’ll tell you that you were born in 
Britain’s last Asian colony and that when we brought you 
home, the staff of our apartment block gathered to wish you 5
well. ‘It’s a boy, so lucky, so lucky. We
Chinese love boys,’ they told us. One 
man said you were the first baby 
to be born in the block that 
year. This, he told
us, was good Feng
Shui, in other words 
a positive sign for
the building and 
everyone who 
lived there

Naturally, your mother and I were only too happy to believe
that. We had wanted you and waited for you, imagined you and
dreamed about you, and now that you are here no dream can do
justice to you. Outside the window, below us on the harbour,
the ferries are ploughing back and forth to Kowloon. Millions
are already up and moving about and the sun is slanting through
the tower blocks and out on to the flat silver waters of the South
China Sea. I can see the trail of a jet over Lamma Island and,
somewhere out there, the last stars flickering towards the other
side of the world.
We have called you Daniel Patrick but I’ve been told by my
Chinese friends that you should have a Chinese name as well,
and this glorious dawn sky makes me think we’ll call you Son of
the Eastern Star. So that later, when you and I are far from Asia,
perhaps standing on a beach some evening, I can point at the
sky and tell you of the Orient and the times and the people we
knew there in the last years of the twentieth century
Your coming has turned me upside down and inside out.
So much that seemed essential to me has, in the past few days,
taken on a different colour. Like many foreign correspondents
I know, I have lived a life that, on occasion, has veered close to
the edge: war zones, natural disasters, darkness in all its shapes
and forms.
In a world of insecurity and ambition and ego, it’s easy to be 7
drawn in, to take chances with our lives, to believe that what we
do and what people say about us is reason enough to gamble
with death. Now, looking at your sleeping face, inches away
from me, listening to your occasional sigh and gurgle, I wonder
how I could have ever thought glory and prizes and praise were
sweeter than life.

Daniel, my painful, haunting memories of suffering children 1
I have come across on my journeys explain some of the fierce 3
protectiveness I feel for you, the tenderness and the occasional ‘E
moments of blind terror when I imagine anything happening to
you. But there is something more, a story from long ago that I I
will tell you face to face, father to son, when you are older. It’s a
very personal story but it’s part of the picture. It has to do with
the long lines of blood and family, about our lives and how we I
can get lost in them and, if we’re lucky, find our way out again 2
into the sunlight.
When you are older, my son, you will learn about how
complicated life becomes, how we can lose our way and how
people get hurt inside and out. When my grandfather died, his
son was too far away to hear his last words, his final breath, and
all the things they might have wished to say to one another were
left unspoken.
Yet now, Daniel, I must tell you that when you let out your
first powerful cry in the delivery room of the Adventist Hospital 1
and I became a father, I thought of your grandfather and, foolish L
though it may seem, hoped that in some way he could hear,
across the infinity between the living and the dead, your proud
statement of arrival. For if he could hear, he would recognise the
distinct voice of family, the sound of hope and new beginnings
that you and all your innocence and freshness have brought to
the world.
