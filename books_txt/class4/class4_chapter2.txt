Sea stars are commonly known as starﬁsh. Although they have this name and they live in the sea they are not ﬁsh at all! They don’t have gills or scales or ﬁns like ﬁsh. They also move very differently. Starﬁsh eat, sleep and move about in rock pools or on the ocean ﬁoor.

Starﬁsh are easy to recognise — they look like stars! There are over 2000 species of different colours, shapes and sizes. Most have ﬁve ‘arms’ or sections arranged around a central disk. They have a tough, bony surface covered in spines and a soft underside. They don’t have eyes like ours; instead they have an eyespot at the end of each arm. If you look closely you might see a tiny red spot. This helps the starﬁsh to sense light and dark but it cannot see any detail.


If you gently turn a starﬁsh over you will see hundreds of tiny, muscular, tube ‘feet’. With these tiny suction feet the starﬁsh crawls along — quicker than you’d think!

Starﬁsh have to protect themselves from being eaten by birds, ﬁsh and other sea, creatures such as sea otters. If they, sense danger they can move and hide under rocks but if that doesn’t work, a starfish has a unique ability to grow a new arm! It takes about a year to grow back.

A starﬁsh can grow a whole new starﬁsh from just one arm and a  piece of the middle disk.

Sitarﬁsh feed on clams, mussels, snails, barnacles and small ﬁsh. They use their arms and feet to hold their prey and pry the shells open. On their underside they have a tiny mouth.

To eat, a starﬁsh must push its stomach through its mouth and into the shell of its prey where it digests the unlucky animal before sliding its stomach back into its own body!
